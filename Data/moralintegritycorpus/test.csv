Some countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, have also made domestic abuse a no-fault offense. It's a no-fault if you've been accused within the legal system. This reduces the amount of time a perpetrator has when it comes to divorce proceedings. And yet, we still see so many cases of domestic abuse on TV. There are countless testimonies of domestic violence in our society. In some circles, the victims are celebrated for daring to speak out, while their abusers get the public shaming they so richly deserve.","care,loyalty"

Some countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, have also made domestic abuse a no-fault offense. It's a no-fault if you've been accused within the legal system. This reduces the amount of time a perpetrator has when it comes to divorce proceedings. And yet, we still see so many cases of domestic abuse on TV. There are countless testimonies of domestic violence in our society. In some circles, the victims are celebrated for daring to speak out, while their abusers get the public shaming they so richly deserve.","care,authority"
