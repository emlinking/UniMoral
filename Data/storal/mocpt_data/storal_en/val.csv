All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His master had told him to call for help should a wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, ""Wolf! wolf!""As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the shepherd boy again shouted, ""Wolf! wolf!""

Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the peacocks was a dress like theirs. So he picked up some castoff feathers of the peacocks and stuck them among his own black plumes. Dressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into the garden among the peacocks. But they soon saw who he was. Angry at the cheat, they flew at him, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own. The poor jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions. There another unpleasant surprise awaited him.

44,"A long time ago in the lush, green forest of oakwood, there lived a deer herd. The herd was very large with twenty deer in it. One of the deer was called lucy. Lucy was very annoying and she never listened. She only had one friend, susan. Susan was very patient and, unlike lucy, susan was a very good listener. Susan and lucy always met at a stream to play. Lucy changed the rules a lot and never listened to susan. Susan did not like how lucy never listened but she stayed her friend because she knew that lucy had no other friends.

For example, whenever billybob joe came to tell everyone that he had found food, he always lead them to it. However, lucy never went because she didn't listen and she didn't hear billybob joe. Furthermore when susan told lucy to come lucy didn't listen and she got in trouble. Because of all this lucy's parents knew that one day their child would not listen to something important. When lucy's parents tried to teach lucy to listen she did not pay attention to them. One day lucy and susan met by the stream and they had just started to play when billybob joe came galloping to the herd yelling, ""The wolves are coming, the wolves are coming!"" The herd began to run. Susan told lucy to come and run away from the wolves, but lucy didn't listen. Susan had to run away, leaving lucy behind. Lucy played a little more until she heard a branch snap. Lucy then saw a wolf in a bush not too far away from her. She then spotted many more wolves all around her. Just as lucy began to run a wolf jumped out of his hiding place, just barely missing her. Lucy ran as fast as she could with the wolf pack hot on her trail. Lucy barely escaped them by jumping over a huge ditch a mile deep. The wolves knew that going around or through the ditch would take way too long so they left. Lucy then went to find her herd.

I'm mouse! nice to meet you.""""I think I know why nobody is your friend."" Mouse said. ""Really?"" Dragon's eyes filled with hope. ""Why?"" She lifted him up to her level with her claw. ""Woah!"" Cried mouse. ""This is fun!"" He brushed off his fur and looked dragon straight in the eye. ""Nobody is your friend because you attack them."" He said. Dragon looked puzzled. ""But they attack me."" She said. ""Only because they are afraid of you. I now know that you only fry us because you're afraid of us."" He made hand gestures as he talked. ""Let me tell you about the golden rule."" He said.

The next day, mouse talked to the king of animalville. ""Sir, I believe that I can do it."" The king stared at him with his bald eagle eyes. ""You?"" ""I'll gather information. and then we can plan an attack. since I'm so small, I can get in for long enough to find out what its weaknesses are, and it won't even see me."" Bald eagle looked up. ""That might work. but if it sees you, you're literally burnt toast!"" Mouse looked at the cave. He glanced back at the town behind him. This might be the only time I ever see it again. He tried to swallow the large lump in his throat and plunged in. For hours, he saw nothing but darkness. Then, an orangey glow began to fill the tunnel. Soon, mouse burst into a large chamber filled with piles of… tissues? Mouse was perplexed. I thought dragons horded gold, not kleenexes. He looked around. Where is the dragon, anyways? Then, he heard a sound almost like… crying? Something was seriously off here. He climbed up one of the kleenex mounds and gazed upon the mountains of tissues. He saw the gigantic red dragon huddled amongst them, blowing her nose. Tears of flame were streaming down her face. ""Why?"" She sobbed. ""Why won't anybody be my friend?"" She blew her nose again and tossed the ashes into another pile. ""Everybody who comes in here tries to hurt me. why?""Mouse decided to go down there. He slid down the pile of kleenexes. ""I don't want to hurt you!"" He said. The dragon's eyes widened. ""Who's there?"" She roared. ""P-please don't come closer!"" She squinted. Mouse stood right in front of her. When she saw him, she jumped. ""Please don't hurt me!"" She cried. Then she realized what she was looking at. ""Hey, you can't hurt me. you're too small!"" Mouse waved. ""Hi there! I'm mouse! nice to meet you.""""I think I know why nobody is your friend."" Mouse said. ""Really?"" Dragon's eyes filled with hope. ""Why?"" She lifted him up to her level with her claw. ""Woah!"" Cried mouse. ""This is fun!"" He brushed off his fur and looked dragon straight in the eye. ""Nobody is your friend because you attack them."" He said. Dragon looked puzzled. ""But they attack me."" She said. ""Only because they are afraid of you. I now know that you only fry us because you're afraid of us."" He made hand gestures as he talked. ""Let me tell you about the golden rule."" He said. ""What's the golden rule?"" Dragon said. An expression of understanding passed over dragon's face. ""So, if I want people to like me, I have to stop breathing fire at them.""Then one solitary tear of fire dripped from her eye. ""But it's too late. everyone is so afraid of me that they won't give me another chance. I'm going to be friendless forever!"" She started bawling her eyes out. Mouse tapped his finger on his chin and then snapped them. ""I wouldn't be so sure about that!"" Bald eagle relaxed, feet kicked up in a comfy recliner in his three-tree castle, watching the crowds gather to see if mouse would make it out. I sure hope mouse makes it! He thought. He took a sip of coffee and walked into the kitchen. As he microwaved some wonderfully delicious salmon casserole, he heard pounding on his tree. He walked over. His assistant, golden eagle, stood there, eyes wide. ""Sir, you have got to see this!"" Bald eagle ran out onto the balcony. The fire dragon was flying towards his tree-castle! It landed next to his tree. And mouse stood on its back! ""How's this for a battle plan?"" Mouse yelled. ""Yes!"" Bald eagle cried. ""Good job, my friend!""The fire dragon and the citizens lived happily ever after. [SEP] When pain, misery or anger happen, it is time to look within you, not around you.","The fire-breathing dragon roared, spitting fire everywhere. A small armadillo scurried away with its tail on fire. The dragon, having vanquished it's enemy, curled up inside its wings. ""At last."" It murmured. A drop of fire dripped from its red eyes.

She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: ""I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want."" The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and told him the case. The ram replied: ""Another time, my dear friend. I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares."" The hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds were quite near, and the hare took to her heels and luckily escaped. [SEP] Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.",4

He hardly left his seat. When people encouraged him to get involved with normal life, he would respond:    -""This is my doorway to the world, there is much more here than you realise.""Among all his games there was one he especially liked. In it he would move a character around, collecting turtles on an infinity of levels and screens. He was a real expert at it. Maybe there was no one else in the world who had collected as many turtles as he had, but, nevertheless, albert still wanted more and more and more…one day, when he got home from school, everything had changed. As usual, as soon as he arrived, he ran to his room to switch the computer on. But this time he heard some strange noises, like breaking glass. Suddenly the screen broke, and from inside came dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of little turtles. And they filled every square inch of his bedroom. Albert was stunned. He couldn't believe what was happening. But after pinching himself, he shut down and started the computer up many times, and called to his parents to see if he was dreaming this. As it happens, he had to accept that on that day something very strange was happening. On entering, his parents put their heads in their hands. Seeing that the turtles were staying in albert's room, they decided to make them his responsibility. Looking after thousands of turtles, day after day, was no easy task. Over the following days albert set himself to learning all he could about turtles. He studied their diet, their habits, and he began to think up ways to feed them. He also tried to trick them into leaving his room, but it never worked. Gradually, he got used to living among turtles, and actually began to enjoy it. He liked playing with them, showing them tricks, and calling them by their names. This despite the fact that feeding them and cleaning up after them hardly left him with any free time. And everyone, including his parents, his friends, and his teachers, enjoyed hearing albert's stories and his growing knowledge about nature.

136,"Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the princess who lived there married a prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the prince to live alone for a long time. The prince's boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn't take long for the prince to find it again. The palace tried to escape many times but the prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the prince's actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold. ""The north pole? how do I get out of here?"" Wondered the prince as he explored his new surroundings. After searching all morning and finding nothing, the prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face. ""Stupid palace! it seems angry with me!""The palace was indeed angry with the prince and shook all its windows to let him know. ""So that's the way you want it?"" Shouted the prince. ""Well, get ready, because this is war. and I have never lost a battle.""In the days that followed, the prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the prince's feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day. Much to his surprise, the prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country. They arrived just before the princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the prince's repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep.

137,"There are many legends dealing with the extinction of dragons, but only one of them involves a certain sir emile, a brave knight who finished off the last thousand dragons. Like many others, sir emile spent years studying the cruel and wicked behaviour of the dragons of his time. However, his own particular conclusions were unique and unusual: dragons lived in a constant state of anger, which created the fire that came from their mouths. So, when he decided to finish the dragons off, he swapped the normal weapons and armour of a knight for something rather unusual: a joke and a cart full of ice creams. When the first dragon came to eat him, sir emile shouted his joke at it. It was such a good joke that even the dragon had to laugh. Just as the brave knight had expected, this blew the dragon's fire out. Just as the dragon was laughing, sir emile offered it an ice cream…how refreshed and pleasant the dragon now felt, after years of having had a fiery throat! Taking advantage of the dragon having calmed down for a moment, sir emile offered it a piece of fruit, and to the dragon this tasted heavenly. Dragons didn't normally eat fruit or vegetables, because the fire of their mouths burned such food and left it without any taste. So they preferred to eat cows or people, which, even though left a bit singed, at least tasted of something.

Just as the dragon was laughing, sir emile offered it an ice cream…how refreshed and pleasant the dragon now felt, after years of having had a fiery throat! Taking advantage of the dragon having calmed down for a moment, sir emile offered it a piece of fruit, and to the dragon this tasted heavenly. Dragons didn't normally eat fruit or vegetables, because the fire of their mouths burned such food and left it without any taste. So they preferred to eat cows or people, which, even though left a bit singed, at least tasted of something. However, when the dragon tasted fresh fruit for the first time, it felt so happy and joyful that even its terrible appearance began to change. It had looked so bad because of its awful diet, but after only a few days of this new, healthier, life, the dragon disappeared one night. All that remained of it was a beautiful butterfly with large colourful wings…and so it was, that sir emile, using only some good jokes and a cart full of ice cream and fruit, made the last thousand dragons disappear and take up new life in the form of beautiful butterflies.

The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers. The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television.

When she came to see that everything about her husband was a false appearance, she didn't hesitate to tell him this to his face, but he answered her back in a similar vein, reminding her that he had only chosen her for her beauty, and that she could have chosen many others rather than himself, if she hadn't let herself be carried away by ambition and her desire to live in a palace. The princess cried for days, seeing the truth in her husband's cruel words. She remembered all the many good and honest young men she'd rejected only so she could become a princess. Wanting to undo her mistake, the princess tried to leave the palace, but the prince wouldn't allow her, since everyone talked about the extraordinary beauty of his wife, and this added to the prince's reputation as an exceptional man. The princess made so many attempts to escape that she ended up locked away, constantly watched by guards. One of those guards felt pity for the princess, and in her captivity he tried to cheer her up and provide some company and conversation for her. As time passed they were becoming good friends. They came to have such confidence in each other that one day the princess asked the guard to allow her to escape. But the soldier, who owed loyalty and obedience to his king did not agree to the princess' plea. Nevertheless, he answered her, saying:   -""If you so want to flee from here, I know how to do it, but it will call for a great sacrifice on your part.""She agreed, confirming that she was willing to do anything, and so the soldier continued:   -""The prince only wants you for your beauty. if you disfigure your face he will send you far away from the palace so no one can see you, and he'll erase any trace of your presence. that's just the despicable, miserable kind of man he is.""The princess replied, saying:   -""Disfigure myself? and where will I go to? what will become of me, if my beauty is all I have? who would want to have anything to do with a horribly ugly and useless woman like me?"" -""I would,"" The soldier answered, confidently. His daily talks with the princess had led him to fall in love with her. -""To me you are even more beautiful on the inside than on the outside.""And at that moment the princess realised that she too loved that simple and honest soldier. With tears in her eyes she took the hand of her guard, and with his dagger in both their hands, they made two long, deep cuts in her face…when the prince saw his wife's face everything happened just as the guard had predicted. The prince sent her as far away as he could, and he made up a tragic story about her death which made him even more popular among the people. And so, disfigured and free, the girl with the beautiful face could finally be happy alongside that simple and loyal soldier.

Knowing how much the young men of the kingdom liked her, she rejected all her suitors, waiting for the arrival of some handsome prince. Well, it didn't take long for a handsome prince to come by, and as soon as he saw the young girl he fell for her and showered her with compliments and gifts. The wedding was extravagant, and everyone said they made the perfect couple.

142,"At the deepest depths of the great mountain, in a huge labyrinth of tunnels created by the great wizards, there lived - imprisoned - the worst of beasts, a horrible creature who all knew as kraton. He had been put there after terrorising the local population. It was a magic labyrinth with only one entrance and exit which changed its position every day. But it so happened that there arrived in that land a man of wicked heart, nasty to the extreme, and his only wish was to rule over all the king's people. His name was jafa, and he was in such a hurry to fulfil his desire that, on hearing of the kraton, he thought of liberating it to help him with his plans, no matter how dangerous the monster was. So, jafa travelled to the great mountain accompanied by all his slaves. There were many of them, and they were so afraid of their master that they didn't take long to find the entrance to the labyrinth. One of these slaves, a very wise man, found out how to know the location of the exit each day, from outside, once jafa was inside the mountain. -""Only one thing more, my lord,"" Said the slave after explaining the system, -""When you're going to exit from the labyrinth, you should wait until it's nighttime. be sure not come out during daylight…""And not wanting to hear any more, jafa entered the labyrinth. From out of a great darkness, jafa started calling for the monster, explaining to the monster his intentions. Jafa would free him from the labyrinth if, in return, kraton would be at jafa's service, terrorising the people there for at least ten years. The monster shouted his agreement with jafa's plan, since all he wanted to do was escape the labyrinth and wreak his revenge. After several days they found each other amid the blackest darkness, and there they cemented their terrible pact. Following the system recommended by jafa's slave, they soon found the way out. On approaching it, brilliant sunlight played upon the exit. Jafa remembered his slave's words. Filled with impatience, the wicked jafa sat down to wait, but the beast, seeing itself free at last, didn't want to listen to talk of waiting, and forgetting their agreement kraton ran out of the labyrinth. From inside, jafa heard kraton's terrible screams of agony. He was scared, but also needed to go and see what had happened to the beast. And though he still remembered his slave's words, he decided to go out. As soon as it touched jafa's face, the sunlight and the light of a thousand mirrors that the wise slave had placed around the exit to illuminate that spot, entered jafa's eyes. Eyes that, due to the darkness they had been in for days, were defenceless to the light, and duly burned out, leaving the impatient jafa blind for the rest of his days, as had happened to the kraton just moments earlier.

Filled with impatience, the wicked jafa sat down to wait, but the beast, seeing itself free at last, didn't want to listen to talk of waiting, and forgetting their agreement kraton ran out of the labyrinth. From inside, jafa heard kraton's terrible screams of agony. He was scared, but also needed to go and see what had happened to the beast. And though he still remembered his slave's words, he decided to go out. As soon as it touched jafa's face, the sunlight and the light of a thousand mirrors that the wise slave had placed around the exit to illuminate that spot, entered jafa's eyes. Eyes that, due to the darkness they had been in for days, were defenceless to the light, and duly burned out, leaving the impatient jafa blind for the rest of his days, as had happened to the kraton just moments earlier. And so, both evil beings, blind, clumsy and impatient, could not even see how their plans had come apart, and remained punished for ever in a life of darkness, along with other creatures of the night.

143,"Valerie was very worried about her daddy. For some time now she had noticed he was going bald. It seemed like every time she looked at him he had less hair than before. One day she rather boldly asked him, ""Daddy, every day you have less hair. why is that?"" Her father smiled and said,""It's the hair thief. round here there's a little pilferer, and he visits my head during the night when I'm asleep. one by one he pulls out my hairs, as many as he likes. and there's no way to catch him!""This worried valerie, but she was determined to help her daddy. That very night she stayed awake as long as she could. As soon as she heard the first snuffles of her father's snoring she grabbed a hammer and went straight to her parents' bedroom. She slowly tiptoed in, being careful not to make a sound. She didn't want the hair thief to hear her. When she arrived at her father's side she began watchfully inspecting his head, determined to catch the hair thief as soon as he appeared. Before long, she saw a shadow on her daddy's head and, with every last ounce of her strength, she swung the hammer down. Thwack! Her father let out an enormous yelp and in a single movement leapt out of bed. The lump on his head was already big, and growing. Trembling with shock, he turned the light on, and saw valerie brandishing her hammer in the air. ""I nearly got him, daddy! I thought I hit him, but it looks like he escaped!"" Meanwhile, all the commotion had woken valerie's mother up. Seeing the lump on her husband's head, she burst out laughing. ""Well, that's what happens when you tell silly stories,"" She said, highly amused.

145,"According to an ancient legend, during a very hot period the big snowy mountain lost her covering of snow and, with it, all her cheerfulness. Streams dried up, trees withered and the mountain became covered in grim grey rock. The moon, who was always bright and shining, wanted to help her friend. However, she was very kind but not very clever and the only thing that occurred to her was to make a hole in her lower part and blow through it softly. In this way, a small amount of the magic dust that made her shine would fall on the mountain in the form of light snow. Once opened, nobody could seal the hole again. The moon didn't mind, however. She continued to blow and after several nights lost all her white dust. Without it, the moon looked so empty that she was almost invisible and the nights became completely dark and sad. Upset by this, the mountain wanted to give the snow back to her friend. However, because it was impossible to make it snow upwards, she lit a fire inside herself until she became a volcano. The fire turned the snow into a dense white smoke that rose up as high as the moon, filling her gradually each night until she was once again full and bright. However, when the snow stopped, and with it the smoke, the hole in the moon remained open, and she had no choice but to share her magic again until she was hollow once more. The moon set off on her travels in the hope of finding another mountain who could turn into a volcano, and she came across a town that needed her help desperately. She was too weak to stop her kind heart so she blew on the town, filling it with happiness until she herself stopped shining. It seemed as if the moon would never shine again but, just like the mountain, the grateful town also found a way to make it snow upwards. So did the next one, and the next, and every one after that. And so, every month, the moon generously sprinkles her magic dust across the world until she disappears, knowing that in a few days her friends would find a way to make her shine brightly again.

146,"Giants and dragons had been enemies for years on end, but they had learned a lot. They were no longer so foolish as to wage wars with terrible battles in which thousands died. Now, every year they held bowling matches instead. A giant against a dragon. Whoever lost would become the winner's slave. If a dragon won, he could use the giant's muscles for all that heavy lifting. If a giant won, he would have free flights and fire for the whole year. That is how they prevented their deaths and yet they hated each other more and more. Every year the winners were so cruel to the losers, in revenge for the times they had lost. There came a time when what mattered most was not winning the bowling match, but rather not losing. Yonk the giant was the best bowler, and the most afraid. He had never lost. Many dragons had been his slaves and they were dying to see him lose so they could get their revenge. This is why yonk was terrified of losing. Especially since last year's match, when he missed his first ever strike and decided that something had to change. The following year he won again. When he arrived home, his slave dragon feared the worst but yonk had a different idea in mind. ""This year you will not be my slave. we will go bowling and I will teach you all of my secrets. but you must promise me one thing: when you win your match next year, you will not be cruel to your giant. do the same as I am doing with you.""The dragon gladly accepted. Yonk kept his promise and he spent the entire year without flying or warming himself with the dragon's fire breathing. The dragon also kept his promise and both did exactly the same every year afterwards. Yonk's idea became so popular that, within just a few years, many giants and dragons were spending their days bowling together. They forgot about their battles and cruelty and treated each other as play friends rather than enemies. Much later yonk lost his first bowling match but he was no longer afraid of losing because, by putting a stop to the enslavement of dragons, he had ended their hatred and sowed the seeds of an almost impossible peace between giants and dragons.

147,"Gus grumplings was never happy with anything. He had lots of friends, and parents who loved him dearly, but all gus could think about was what he didn't have, or things he did have which he was unhappy with. If someone gave him a car, it would be too big or too slow. If he went to the zoo, he'd come back disappointed because they hadn't let him feed the lions. If he played football with his friends, he would complain, saying there were too many of them for just one ball…what caught gus unaware was chuckles the prankster cloud. One day, chuckles was drifting past, and heard all of gus's complaining. Chuckles wafted over to see. When the cloud was right above gus, he started dropping heavy black rain on him. That was chuckles' favourite trick to play on grumpy little kids. Gus wasn't at all impressed by this new development; it just made him complain even more. He was even angrier after he realised that the cloud was following him. Well, this carried on for almost a week. Gus couldn't get away from the cloud, and he got more and more infuriated. Gus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called gladys. Gladys was the only one who had been willing to hang around with gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other children had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black. One day, when gus was at the end of his tether, she said to him: ""Cheer up! what you should realise is that you're the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better, its rain is black! we could play some fun games with a cloud like this, don't you reckon?"" As gladys was his only company these days, and he didn't want her to leave as the others had, gus reluctantly agreed. Gladys took him to the swimming pool, and left him there until all the pool water was black. Then she went and got other kids. They came and played in the pool. The water being black meant they could play hide and seek! Grudgingly, gus had to admit it had been a lot of fun, but what was even more fun was playing wet the cat. Gus would find cats and run alongside them. When the cats felt themselves getting wet they would jump about in the craziest way, and run off at top speed, with funny looks on their faces. Before long, all the children in town had gathered around gus, thinking up new games they could play using the cloud. For the first time ever, gus started to see the positive side of things; even things which, at first, had seemed so bad. Chuckles, the prankster cloud, thought that he could now leave; his work had been done. But, before leaving, he gave gus two days of multicoloured rain, with which the children invented the most fun games ever. When chuckles finally left, gus didn't complain. Now he knew to focus on the good in life, and the good thing about chuckles' departure was that no longer was gus soaking wet all day.

He looked at everything as though it were a beautiful painting, and, in the blink of an eye, he could paint anything at all, filling it with magic and colour. One day, brian and his grandfather went to spend a weekend at the palace of the marquis of castling. The marquis was an old friend of brian's grandfather; and was a very famous chess player. When they arrived, brian went into a large room and found a lovely chess set, totally hand carved, and with its own marble table which acted as the board. This chess set caught brian's artistic eye. However, he felt that these pieces were too uniform. Along with the blacks and whites of the board, it amounted to rather a bland set. So, that night, - paint box in hand - he tiptoed from his room to the chess room. There he spent the night painting each piece in the most colourful way. When the pieces were done, he painted a beautiful scene on the marble chessboard. Brian hoped to use his art to really surprise his grandfather and the marquis. However, the next morning, when the marquis discovered that his pieces had been covered in a thousand colours, instead of being pleased, he was very angry. That afternoon he had a very important match to play. However lovely all those colours were, it would be impossible to play chess without being able to know which pieces were which; and even more difficult now that the squares of the board were covered with a painting. Brian's grandfather explained to him that even the loveliest, most colourful things need some sense of order to them. The boy felt very hurt, remembering how many times his paintings had annoyed people…but brian bristles was a true artist, and he wasn't about to give up easily. A little while later he went to his grandfather and the marquis, and asked their permission to rectify what he had done to the chess set. Knowing how ingeniously artistic the boy was, they decided to give him a chance, so brian went off and spent hours alone with his paints. When he was finished, shortly before the match was about to begin, he called for the two men and showed them his work. What a beautiful chess set it now was! Now there were two perfectly recognisable teams; that of night and that of day. On one side, the board and the pieces had been decorated with dozens of stars and moons of all sizes and colours. On the other side the decorations were suns, clouds, and rainbows. It was done so well that the whole set had an unmatchable sense of order and harmony.

Now there were two perfectly recognisable teams; that of night and that of day. On one side, the board and the pieces had been decorated with dozens of stars and moons of all sizes and colours. On the other side the decorations were suns, clouds, and rainbows. It was done so well that the whole set had an unmatchable sense of order and harmony. Brian understood that a little order had been missing, but he had now managed to impose some without giving up any colour. The two grown-ups looked at the paintings and smiled. It was obvious that brian bristles would become a great artist. [SEP] What ever we have done in past but still we can change our life and people views towards us. So never give up.

One day, when some people were visiting, juan felt so ashamed that he hid in a bedroom. Suddenly, a bubble appeared right in front of him, and out of it came a little elf. With exaggerated gestures of pain, the elf covered his large ears with his hands and shouted:   -""Please! please! stop screaming like that.

151,"Once upon a time a king ordered his two sons to build two large aqueducts to supply water to his country estates, which were in a very poor state due to a great drought. The first son took part of his father's riches and part of the army. With them he travelled north where he ordered the people of those lands to work hard on building the aqueduct. He oversaw the work very carefully, paying the villagers fairly, and finishing the project within the predicted two years. Proud of his work, he returned to the palace, only to find the place in the midst of celebrations for the coming crowning of his brother as king.

155,"Johnny the lizard lived between some rocks out in the country. Like all lizards he loved to quietly sunbathe, laid out on some flat stone. He felt so relaxed doing so, that more than once he had fallen asleep, and that's exactly what happened on the day he lost his tail: some kids caught him, and johnny could only escape by losing his tail and running to hide. Shocked and frightened, he listened to how the children laughed at seeing his tail continue moving about, even though it was no longer attached to his body. After a while they threw the tail away. When the children had gone, johnny started looking everywhere for his tail, wanting to reattach it to its rightful place. However, the countryside was very big, and as much as he searched for it, johnny could find no sign of his tail. He left everything else in his life, devoting himself to the search. He forgot about his home, his possessions, his friends. Days and months passed, and johnny kept looking, asking everyone he met whether they had seen his tail. One day, someone he asked surprisedly replied, -""Why do you need two tails?"" Johnny turned and saw that after so much time spent searching he had grown a new tail. What's more, his new tail looked stronger and better than his old tail. Seeing this, he realised how silly it had been to dedicate so much time to a problem for which there was no solution. Johnny turned back and headed for home. On his way home he found his old tail at the side of the way. It was dry and dusty, and looked really bad. However, johnny, having spent so much time looking for it, was happy to find it, and he picked it up and resumed his journey. Soon he met a frog. The frog, surprised, asked johnny:   -""Why are you carrying such a horrible old tail when you already have such a lovely tail of your own?"" -""Because I spent months looking for it,"" Replied johnny. -""You really spent months looking for something so ugly and dirty?"" Said the frog. -""Well,""Johnny explained, -""Previously it wasn't as ugly as this…"" -""Hmm, but now it is, wouldn't you agree?… how strange you lizards are!"" Said the frog before jumping off into the distance. The frog was right. Johnny still thought of his tail as though it was the same tail he used to have, but in reality it was now disgusting. Now johnny understood, so he decided to drop his old tail there, leaving with it all his past worries. As he continued his journey all he took with him were thoughts of the future.

156,"In a land far away, once upon a time there was great poverty: only the rich could manage without great problems. Three of those rich men, and their servants, were traveling on the same road, in a convoy, when they came to a very poor village. Seeing this poverty provoked different reactions in all three rich men. The first couldn't stand to see it, so he took all the gold and jewels from his wagons and shared them out among the villagers. He wished them all the best of luck, and he left. The second rich man, seeing the desperate situation, stopped for a short time, and gave the villagers all his food and drink, since he could see that money would be of little use to them. He made sure that each villager received their fair share and would have enough food to last for some time. Then, he left. The third rich man, on seeing such poverty, speeded up and traveled straight through the village without stopping. The two other rich men saw this from a distance, and commented with each other how the third rich man lacked decency and compassion. It was good that they had been there to help the poor villagers…however, three days later, they met the third rich man who was traveling in the opposite direction. He was still traveling quickly, but his wagons, instead of the gold and valuables they had been carrying, were now full of farming implements, tools, and sacks of seeds and grain. He was heading to the poor village to help them out of poverty. This happened a long, long time ago, but we can see the very same thing happening today too.

157,"In a garden filled with bushes, out from between a load of grass and weeds, there appeared, as if from nowhere, a white rose. It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like velvet, and the morning dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower couldn't see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent the few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were amazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance. She didn't realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded her were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and appearance. One hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely things mother nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part of the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt. -""It's days since it rained,"" She thought, -""If the rose stays here till tomorrow it'll be totally withered. I'll take it home and put it in the lovely vase I got as a present.""And so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a lovely colourful glass vase, and placed it by the window. -""I'll put it here,"" She thought, -""So the flower can get some sun.""What the young girl didn't realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for the first time, the rose got to see herself and what she looked like. -""Is that me?"" Thought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up towards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she was totally back to her best she looked at her reflection and saw that she was indeed a beautiful flower. She thought    -""Wow! till now I hadn't realised who I was, how could I have been so blind?""The rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable to see herself, unable to know who she really was.

159,"The day finally arrived. It was time for the great acrobatic balloon competition. Every insect in the garden had been training hard, and now they were preparing to begin their routines. The balloon competitions were always something really special, since they could only happen after the children of the house had had some big party. There was only a short window of opportunity too, before the parents came round to collect up the balloons. Each time, the flying insects were favourites to win, because they could grab the balloon strings and fly off in all directions, creating all sorts of patterns in the air. However, on this occasion there were some rather unusual insects taking part: a group of ants. Of course, no one expected that they'd do anything special. They were so light that no ant had ever bothered to take part, but it was quite impressive to see all the ants all perfectly organised and prepared. So the competition began, and the different insects took their turns, performing beautiful manoeuvres with the balloons. As always, the butterfly and the firefly left everyone amazed with their twist and turns, and their wonderful colours. When it was time for the ants to perform, it seemed like the competition had already been decided. For the first time in living memory, the ants shared just one balloon between them, and one by one they climbed up the balloon string; forming a thin black thread of ants. When all the string was covered, the last ant climbed over his teammates to reach the balloon. Once there, he climbed onto the top of the balloon. This strange spectacle attracted everyone's curiosity, and they were just about to witness the most important moment: the ant opened his jaws as wide as he could… and then he stabbed the balloon with all his might! Pssshhhhhhh! !! The result was tremendous! The balloon began blowing out its air, flying madly about, here and there, doing a thousand pirouettes, while the perfectly synchronised ants, made all kinds of beautiful shapes out of the string. Of course, that acrobatic flight ended with quite a hard landing, but it didn't matter. The originality and teamwork of the ant performance was so impressive that the crowd didn't even have to vote for there to be a winner. From then on, in that garden, everyone understood how much could be achieved by working together. In the years to come, the balloon competitions were full of displays carried out by teams, and they put on some wonderful routines; something those individual insects could never have achieved on their own.

She kept the red people in the red houses, the green children playing on the swings of the green parks, and the parents talking all day in the town square. It was a sweet and perfect little world, and paula dreamed that one day she might be able to spend a day in tidyland.

However, before she got there, a giant hand swooped down out of the sky and grabbed her. It took her by the arm and moved her back to where she had started from, next to the pink palace. Paula was a bit shocked by this, but she managed to put it out of her mind, because she caught sight of her beloved red houses, and off she went to take a closer look.

161,"Billy peck was a farm duck whose big dream was to become a tightrope walker. Every day he spent hours out on the rope, practicing, encouraged by his faithful friend, artie quack. Artie was an older duck who, when young, had practiced that very same art. Both of them were a bit flap-footed at it, but they had never let that get in the way of doing all they could to keep training and hopefully improve. One day, a new ram arrived at the farm. Soon after noticing the ducks' tightrope practice, he came over and began praising them. He said they were doing great, and he bet they could cross any precipice on that rope of theirs. This left billy feeling highly encouraged, despite artie commenting that he hadn't noticed any real improvement. A few days later, billy found himself with the ram, looking across a ravine. The gap was so wide that no one could jump it. You could only cross it using a tightrope. Artie tried to talk his friend out of it. He wanted him to realise that he wasn't such a great tightrope walker, and this thing with the ravine would be really dangerous. The ram disagreed, assuring them that billy peck was the best tightrope walker in the whole region, and that artie quack was just jealous of him. Both ducks got angry, and artie refused to help with the tightrope walk. On the ravine, the ram egged billy on, to reach the other side. But as soon as he had stepped out onto the rope billy lost his balance, and fell. Fortunately he landed on a small ledge, but when he asked the ram to help him up, he discovered that he had disappeared. Billy pecks had to spend quite some time there, and even worse, his leg was broken. He realised that his old friend artie had been telling him the truth all along. He saw that it couldn't have been easy for artie to tell him that he wasn't a good tightrope walker, and billy was grateful to have such a good friend who would always tell him the truth… and artie really was a good friend, because, knowing what was about to happen, he had gone straight off to find a group of wild ducks - old friends of his. These wild ducks flew much better than the poor old farm ducks. Artie prepared a rescue operation with the wild ducks. Billy asked artie to forgive him, and artie happily did so. And, while being rescued, and flying high, billy could see that over on the other side of the ravine there was a load of well-hidden and delicious delicacies. Billy realised that that was all the greedy ram had been interested in. He wanted those foods, but couldn't cross the ravine himself, so had tried to use billy to get them. Billy felt foolish, but also fortunate, because helped by his new duck friends they managed to gather all that wonderful food, take it to the farm, and have a big party among real friends.

They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways to explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper planes…it didn't seem like any of this bothered the new kid. However, little lewis was sure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside. So, one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school; lewis was sure he would see him crying. On leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for a while, until someone came along to meet him…it was the new teacher! The teacher gave the new kid a hug, and off they went, hand in hand. Following from a distance, lewis could hear they were talking about math. And that stupid new kid knew everything about it, much more than anyone in the class! [SEP] Freedom is the most valuable gift. Without it, nothing we do has meaning.",4
164,"The block appeared in the middle of the forest one morning. It was a huge block of ice, as tall as a tree, as big as a hundred elephants. What's more, it was so cold that no one dared to go near. But what intrigued the animals most was the wonderful treasure they could see inside it. The treasure looked so splendid that the lion king himself said that whoever could get it out would be made his successor as king. As soon as he said this, all the animals lost their dislike of the cold and leapt at the block, furiously trying to secure the treasure. Well, everyone except for the weasel, who stood for a while looking at the block, watching the other animals creating a huge commotion, piled on top of each other. The elephant was using his trunk as a hammer, and ended up whacking the gorilla. The two later had to go to hospital. The tiger was using his claws like a hammer drill, but they got stuck in the ice, and when he finally managed to pull his paw out the claws broke off. Several gazelles, realising the block was made of cold water, tried to lick the block away. But the extreme cold of the water gave them an upset stomach. The monkeys were determined to destroy the block, and they threw bananas and stones at the rate of machine guns. But they hit so many of the other animals that they had to stop. And so it went on, all the animals trying to break the block using brute force, the whole day long, and without success. At the pace they were going, and seeing how slow the progress was, they realised that it would take them over a week.

It was hard to make out, but something was scampering about in the middle of the block, right next to the treasure…was the treasure alive? Did the treasure have an owner living with it? Nothing like it! It was the weasel, who soon appeared in their midst with some pieces of the treasure. They were all impressed to see how the weasel had gotten to the treasure without breaking the block apart. After congratulating her, they asked her how she'd done it. The weasel told them that before leaping at the problem she had taken some time to think and observe. She concluded that the block was too big to break it up with force, and it would take too long for the sun to melt it. Then it occurred to her that she could get to the middle of the block from underneath, by digging a tunnel. At the end of her tunnel she built a small fire, which quickly melted a hole in the ice above. So, with little effort the weasel got to the treasure!

165,"You know, they reckon ken the wizard and clive the magician had one of the best flea collections in world history. Those fleas were the cleverest, liveliest, strongest fleas of their era, and most useful for all sorts of spells. Ken and clive never went anywhere without at least a thousand fleas on them, always kept safely in one of their bizarre glass bags, so that everyone could appreciate the fleas' special qualities. One time, ken and clive happened upon each other in a forest. Chatting and joking, time passed by quickly and they realised that it was so late that they would have to camp out in the forest that night. While they were sleeping, clive the magician sneezed with such magical violence that thousands of white-hot sparks shot out of his nose. Ken and clive had left their precious fleas on some leaves for the night and, unfortunately, one of the sparks landed on a leaf and the whole lot set alight. As the fire started spreading, the two magicians continued sleeping, and their fleas began to look decidedly nervous. They were all terribly clever and strong, so each one of the fleas thought of their own strategy to escape the fire. However, as they were still inside the bags, and they each jumped in all different directions, this meant that the bags stayed exactly where they were. One of the fleas noticed how they were all leaping in different directions, with no coordination. He realised that they would never escape like that. He stopped jumping, and gathered a group of fleas who he convinced to jump all at once. As they couldn't agree where to jump to, the flea suggested that they all jump first forward and then backward. The group started jumping together, and the rest of the fleas in the sack didn't take long to understand that jumping together would make it easier to escape the fire. So, soon all the fleas were jumping forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards… the fleas in the other bag saw this and imitated it. The two glass bags were now rolling backwards and forwards, towards each other, and with one last effort they collided and both bags shattered into a thousand pieces, setting the fleas free. By the time the fire had woken the magicians, it was already too late. Although they managed to put out the fire, their precious fleas had jumped far off into the night.

169,"There was once a rich and kindly old man who, reaching the end of his days, decided to leave his possessions to some honest and intelligent young man. Speaking of this decision, he told a good friend that he wanted to choose wisely. The friend advised him,""The next time you sell something, and are giving the customer their change, make sure you give them too much. the customer who returns the extra money to you, you will know that they are honest"". The rich man thanked his friend for the advice, and thinking it a good idea, and easy to carry out, he decided to try it. What he did not know was this. One of those present during the conversation - a neighbour who pretended to be his friend, but was really very envious of the rich old man - hired the services of a wizard. He paid the wizard to cast a spell on the rich old man's coins. The spell would mean that anyone who saw coins touched by the old man, rather than seeing them as coins, would see them as that which the customer wanted most in the world. With this plan, the envious neighbour believed that no customer would return the old man's change, and, having no one to leave his money to, the old man would leave it all to the neighbour's young nephew. Indeed, everything went according to plan for the greedy neighbour, and not a single customer was able to return the enchanted coins. Some saw in these coins the biggest diamond or precious stone, others saw a work of art, some saw a relic, and some saw a miraculous healing potion. When the old man had almost given up trying to find an honest person, the greedy neighbour sent his nephew to the old man's business, taking great care to instruct the boy to return the old man's money.

With this plan, the envious neighbour believed that no customer would return the old man's change, and, having no one to leave his money to, the old man would leave it all to the neighbour's young nephew. Indeed, everything went according to plan for the greedy neighbour, and not a single customer was able to return the enchanted coins. Some saw in these coins the biggest diamond or precious stone, others saw a work of art, some saw a relic, and some saw a miraculous healing potion. When the old man had almost given up trying to find an honest person, the greedy neighbour sent his nephew to the old man's business, taking great care to instruct the boy to return the old man's money. The nephew was determined to do so, but on receiving the enchanted coins he saw in them all the possessions and honours of his own uncle. Believing that what his uncle had told him was a trick, he left with his useless coins and his greed, to no end, since when his uncle learned of this betrayal, he made his nephew banish forever. The rich old man, sick and depressed, decided to call his servants before he died. He gave them some possessions so that they could live freely when he was no longer with them. Among these servants was a youth, who received some portion of this money by mistake. The youth, raised in the house of the wise and just old man, who he loved like a father, saw, in place of the money, a powerful medicine which would cure the old man, since this was truly what he most wanted in the world. On seeing this, the youth offered the money back to the old man, saying ""Take this, sir, it's for you; it will make you feel better.""And the return of that simple coin indeed acted like the most miraculous of cures. The old man leapt with joy at having finally found an honest person, and it filled him with joy to find that this honest person had always been in his very own house. And so, the young servant went on to manage, with great justice, generosity and honesty, all the old man's possessions and business concerns. And the old man went on to accompany and advise him like a son for many more years. [SEP] We should respect and care for everyone. We should not neglect or ignore them. Everyone is important.",2
170,"There was once a little bird who was very nice, but very, very lazy. Every day, when it was time to get up, they had to shout at him again and again before he would finally struggle out of bed. And when there was some job he had to do, he would keep putting it off until there was hardly enough time left to do it. People kept telling him ""What a lazy bird you are! you can't just keep leaving everything to the last minute"". ""Bah! there's really no problem"", answered the little bird, ""I just take a bit longer to get around to doing things, that's all"". The birds spent all summer flying and playing, and when autumn came and you could start feeling the cold, they began to prepare for the long journey to a warmer land. But our little bird, lazy as ever, kept putting it off, feeling quite sure that there would be plenty of time to prepare for the journey. That was, until one day when he woke up and all the other birds were gone. Just like every other day, several of his friends had tried to wake him, but - half asleep - he told them he would get up later. He had gone back to sleep and only woke up again much later. That day was the day of the great journey. Everyone knew the rules: you had to be ready to leave; there were thousands of birds, and they weren't going to wait around for anyone. So the little bird, who didn't know how to make the journey alone, realised that because of his laziness, he would have to spend the long cold winter all on his own. At the beginning, he spent a lot of time crying, but he had to admit that it was his own fault. He knew he could do things well when he put his mind to it so, putting his laziness aside, he began to prepare for the winter. First, he spent days looking for the place that was best protected from the cold. He found a place between some rocks, and there he made a new nest, well built with branches, stones and leaves. Then, he worked tirelessly to fill the nest with fruits and berries, enough to last the whole winter. Finally, he dug a little pool in the cave, so he would have enough water. When he saw that his new home was perfectly prepared, he began to train himself on how to get by on very little food and water, so that he would be able to endure the worst snowstorms. And, although many would not have believed it, all these preparations meant that the little bird did survive through the winter. Of course, he suffered greatly, and not a day of that winter went by without him regretting having been such a lazy little bird. When the spring finally arrived, and his old friends returned from their voyage, they were all filled with joy and surprise at seeing that the little bird was still alive. They could hardly believe that such a lazy bird had managed to build such a wonderful nest. And when they realised that not even a bit of laziness remained in his little body, and that he had turned into the most hard-working bird of the flock, everyone agreed that he should be put in charge of organising the great journey next year. When that time came, everything was so well done and so well prepared that they even had time left to invent an early morning wake-up song, so that from that day on no little bird, however lazy, would have to spend the winter alone again.

171,"Claudio was really happy with the way the work had been allocated. Of everything that needed preparing for the birth of jesus, he had been given 'the speaker'. But it wasn't just any speaker: it was the speaker through which the voices of the angels and god himself would be heard on earth from heaven. Claudio was just an ordinary angel but had been very lucky because the bulk of the important tasks had been given to the most impressive and brilliant archangels and to other more senior angels. As everyone already knew, he was more than just a charming angel: he was also a whiz with technology, which is why they thought he would be ideal to create such a complicated device. Claudio had a thousand ideas for the design in his head and he set to work immediately. He hadn't been working long before raphael, one of his favourite archangels, came along. ""Can you please give us a hand with the palace, claudio? we need a door that opens automatically for mary and joseph."" ""Of course!"" - he said, willingly as ever - ""This can wait."" It took claudio several days to finish the complicated door, and even more to complete the other jobs that raphael kept asking him to do. But it was all worth it: they built a palace worthy of the greatest king on earth. It was so good that, when no one was looking, the angels came out of heaven to admire it. Claudio was walking back so he could work on his speaker when michael the archangel spotted him from afar. ""Claudio, could you please help us with the finishing touches in wardrobe? when the choir sings we want the clothes of those listening to shine with gold, precious stones and colourful lights and the clothes of mary, joseph and the son of god to sway with the rhythm of the music.""""What a fantastic idea, miguel! that will be amazing. I'll be there right away.""Even though it took several days to finish the costumes, they could not have created anything more beautiful. Angels came from every corner of the universe to marvel at their beauty and congratulate michael warmly. Gabriel also asked claudio to help him with the lights and sound effects for the heavenly choir. Then the cherubs arrived asking for lots of help, as did large numbers of senior angels with jobs so important that claudio had no choice but to assist them. Everything was perfect. The angels were happy and congratulated one another proudly. That same night, the eve of the birth of the baby jesus, they celebrated with a big party. But claudio couldn't go. After so much work, he remembered that he had his own job to do - the speaker- which he had still not started! Alone and in a hurry, claudio worked on his speaker and could hear the background music from the party. He had tears in his eyes as he worked, knowing he wouldn't finish on time. Suddenly god himself appeared by his side. ""Hello my dear claudio. what are you doing here and not at the party?"" The little angel felt ashamed and, holding back the tears, showed him the partly finished speaker. ""I see. I know that you were busy helping others. but is no one coming to help you?""""Well, they are celebrating at the big party and they deserve it"", answered claudio. ""They have worked very hard and everything has turned out brilliantly. also, they couldn't help me even if they wanted to: this speaker is very complicated.""""Hmmm"" Was the only thing god said as he turned around. He didn't seem very happy. Claudio was terrified. He knew that the only way he would get there in time was if god decided to help him, but he was too embarrassed to ask. As if he had read his mind, god turned to claudio and said: ""Well, do the best you can, but make sure it is really loud.""Claudio didn't have time.

Even the beautiful clothes of all who were there to witness the birth flew across the air, now nothing more than rags.

Of everything that needed preparing for the birth of jesus, he had been given 'the speaker'. But it wasn't just any speaker: it was the speaker through which the voices of the angels and god himself would be heard on earth from heaven. Claudio was just an ordinary angel but had been very lucky because the bulk of the important tasks had been given to the most impressive and brilliant archangels and to other more senior angels. As everyone already knew, he was more than just a charming angel: he was also a whiz with technology, which is why they thought he would be ideal to create such a complicated device. Claudio had a thousand ideas for the design in his head and he set to work immediately. He hadn't been working long before raphael, one of his favourite archangels, came along. ""Can you please give us a hand with the palace, claudio? we need a door that opens automatically for mary and joseph."" ""Of course!"" - he said, willingly as ever - ""This can wait."" It took claudio several days to finish the complicated door, and even more to complete the other jobs that raphael kept asking him to do. But it was all worth it: they built a palace worthy of the greatest king on earth. It was so good that, when no one was looking, the angels came out of heaven to admire it. Claudio was walking back so he could work on his speaker when michael the archangel spotted him from afar. ""Claudio, could you please help us with the finishing touches in wardrobe? when the choir sings we want the clothes of those listening to shine with gold, precious stones and colourful lights and the clothes of mary, joseph and the son of god to sway with the rhythm of the music.""""What a fantastic idea, miguel! that will be amazing. I'll be there right away.""Even though it took several days to finish the costumes, they could not have created anything more beautiful. Angels came from every corner of the universe to marvel at their beauty and congratulate michael warmly. Gabriel also asked claudio to help him with the lights and sound effects for the heavenly choir. Then the cherubs arrived asking for lots of help, as did large numbers of senior angels with jobs so important that claudio had no choice but to assist them. Everything was perfect. The angels were happy and congratulated one another proudly. That same night, the eve of the birth of the baby jesus, they celebrated with a big party. But claudio couldn't go. After so much work, he remembered that he had his own job to do - the speaker- which he had still not started! Alone and in a hurry, claudio worked on his speaker and could hear the background music from the party. He had tears in his eyes as he worked, knowing he wouldn't finish on time. Suddenly god himself appeared by his side. ""Hello my dear claudio. what are you doing here and not at the party?"" The little angel felt ashamed and, holding back the tears, showed him the partly finished speaker. ""I see. I know that you were busy helping others. but is no one coming to help you?""""Well, they are celebrating at the big party and they deserve it"", answered claudio. ""They have worked very hard and everything has turned out brilliantly. also, they couldn't help me even if they wanted to: this speaker is very complicated.""""Hmmm"" Was the only thing god said as he turned around. He didn't seem very happy. Claudio was terrified. He knew that the only way he would get there in time was if god decided to help him, but he was too embarrassed to ask. As if he had read his mind, god turned to claudio and said: ""Well, do the best you can, but make sure it is really loud.""Claudio didn't have time. He had just finished putting the pieces together in time and he managed to reach his place by the skin of his teeth, just as gabriel was giving the signal to begin. The choir cleared their voices and for a second everyone was looking at claudio. He closed his eyes, said a prayer and put the speaker on full volume. Boooooom! !! A huge explosion shook heaven as it opened up to send the angels' hymn to earth. The explosion was so great that it was like an earthquake or a hurricane on earth, destroying all the preparations. The palace collapsed completely except for the remains of a few walls. The place felt cold, uncomfortable, dirty and untidy. Even the beautiful clothes of all who were there to witness the birth flew across the air, now nothing more than rags. In a matter of seconds, all that remained intact were the voices of the heavenly choir and a bright flash from the huge speaker which was slowly burning. No one in heaven dared say anything. Claudio was very embarrassed. Everyone was looking at him in pity and disappointment but they too were embarrassed for having left him all alone. Just then jesus was born but instead of the cries of a baby, which was what everyone was expecting, happy laughter filled heaven and earth.

The painter did as was requested, giving the dragon an incredible appearance. The dragon liked it so much that he often asked the painter to make some new changes and retouch his work. Over time, the dragon began to treat him better, almost like a friend. However, as much as the painter asked him, the dragon wasn't prepared to let him go free, and he took the painter everywhere with him. During one of these journeys the painter and the dragon arrived at a great mountain. They were making their way around it when they realised the mountain was moving… and it began to roar with such a noise that left the dragon half dead with fear. In reality, that mountain was a giant titan who felt so angry and offended at the dragon's presence that he assured the dragon he wouldn't rest until he had flattened him. The dragon, frightened by the titan's size, apologised and tried to explain that he had arrived there by mistake. But the titan was determined to destroy the dragon. -""But listen, great titan, I'm a dragon and I can be very useful to you,"" Said the dragon. -""You? little dwarf dragon? help me? you know how to do anything of use? ha ha haaaa!"" -""I'm a dragon, and I shoot fire from my mouth.

173,"Martin was now so old that for his birthday that year his father gave him a book without any pictures in it! Martin's father noticed his disappointment, and told him, ""Son, this isn't just any old book, it's a magic book. but to discover its magic you'll have to read it.""Well, that was better; martin liked everything to do with magic. He started reading it, even though he wasn't overly enthusiastic. The next morning, his father asked him,""Have you found the magic key?""So… there was a key to find! Martin ran off and flicked through the book, but there was no sign of the key. He came back, very annoyed, but his father warned him, ""You won't find it like that. you have to read the book."" Martin didn't have much patience, and he stopped reading the book, thinking his father was trying to trick him into reading a bit more, just as martin's teacher had suggested to his dad. A little later, his sister, angela, who was just a bit younger than him, asked him for the book so she could try reading it. After several days of trying to read it without great success, she appeared in the lounge, happily screaming,""I've found it! I've found the key of the magic book!"" And she would not stop talking about all the worlds and places she had visited using that magic key. All the talk ended up convincing martin to resume reading the book.

174,"There was once a boy who had two naughty little toy men.

176,"The mokoko tribe lived on the wrong side of the island of two faces. The two sides, separated by a great cliff, were like night and day. The good side was watered by rivers and was filled with trees, flowers, birds and easy and abundant food, while on the wrong side there was hardly any water or plants, and wild beasts crowded together. The mokoko had the misfortune of having always lived there, with no way to cross to the other side. Their life was hard and difficult: they hardly had food and drink for everyone and they lived in permanent terror of the beasts, who would regularly come and eat some tribe member. Legend told that some of their ancestors had been able to cross with just the help of a small pole, but for many years not a single tree had grown that would be strong enough to make such a pole, so few mokoko believed this was possible, and they had become accustomed and resigned to their difficult, resigned life, suffering hunger and dreaming of not ending up as some peckish beast's dinner. But nature had it that, precisely along the edge of the cliff separating the two sides of the island, a skinny but strong tree grew, with which they could build two poles. The feeling of anticipation was enormous and there was no doubt among the tribe as to whom they would choose to use the poles: the great chief and the witch doctor. But when the two of them were given their opportunity to make the jump, they felt so afraid that they didn't dared to: they thought that the pole could break, or it would not be long enough, or that something would go wrong during the jump … and they put so much energy into these thoughts that the resulting fear caused them to give in. And when they saw that this could lead them to being teased and taunted, they decided to invent some old stories and legends about failed jumps to the other side. And they told so many of these tales and they spread so much that there was no mokoko who did not know how reckless and foolish you would have to be to even attempt the jump. And there lay the poles, available to anyone wanting to use them, but abandoned by all, because taking up one of these poles had become, by dint of repetition, the most unbecoming thing a mokoko could do. It was a betrayal of the values of suffering and resistance which so  distinguished the tribe. But into that tribe were born naru and ariki, a pair of young hearts truly wanting a different life and, encouraged by the strength of their love, one day decided to take up the poles. Nobody stopped them, but everyone did try to discourage them, trying to convincing them of the dangers of jumping, using a thousand explanations. -""And what if what they say is true?"" Wondered the young naru. -""Don't' worry. why do the talk so much about a leap they've never done? I too am a bit scared, but it doesn't look so difficult,"" Replied ariki, ever determined. -""But if it goes wrong, it would be a terrible end,"" Continued naru, undecided. -""Perhaps the jump will go badly, and perhaps not. but staying forever on this side of the island surely won't work out well either. do you know of anyone whose death did not come from being either eaten by the wild beasts or from famine? that too is a terrible end, although it still seems far away to us."" -""You're right, ariki. and if we wait much longer we won't have the strength to make the leap … let's do it tomorrow.""And on the next day, naru and ariki jumped to the good side of the island. When taking up the poles, taking their run up, while feeling their desire, the fear hardly allowed them to breathe.

We don't know what destiny had in store for us.. Never lose hope and keep trying.","The mokoko tribe lived on the wrong side of the island of two faces. The two sides, separated by a great cliff, were like night and day. The good side was watered by rivers and was filled with trees, flowers, birds and easy and abundant food, while on the wrong side there was hardly any water or plants, and wild beasts crowded together. The mokoko had the misfortune of having always lived there, with no way to cross to the other side. Their life was hard and difficult: they hardly had food and drink for everyone and they lived in permanent terror of the beasts, who would regularly come and eat some tribe member. Legend told that some of their ancestors had been able to cross with just the help of a small pole, but for many years not a single tree had grown that would be strong enough to make such a pole, so few mokoko believed this was possible, and they had become accustomed and resigned to their difficult, resigned life, suffering hunger and dreaming of not ending up as some peckish beast's dinner. But nature had it that, precisely along the edge of the cliff separating the two sides of the island, a skinny but strong tree grew, with which they could build two poles. The feeling of anticipation was enormous and there was no doubt among the tribe as to whom they would choose to use the poles: the great chief and the witch doctor. But when the two of them were given their opportunity to make the jump, they felt so afraid that they didn't dared to: they thought that the pole could break, or it would not be long enough, or that something would go wrong during the jump … and they put so much energy into these thoughts that the resulting fear caused them to give in. And when they saw that this could lead them to being teased and taunted, they decided to invent some old stories and legends about failed jumps to the other side. And they told so many of these tales and they spread so much that there was no mokoko who did not know how reckless and foolish you would have to be to even attempt the jump. And there lay the poles, available to anyone wanting to use them, but abandoned by all, because taking up one of these poles had become, by dint of repetition, the most unbecoming thing a mokoko could do. It was a betrayal of the values of suffering and resistance which so  distinguished the tribe. But into that tribe were born naru and ariki, a pair of young hearts truly wanting a different life and, encouraged by the strength of their love, one day decided to take up the poles. Nobody stopped them, but everyone did try to discourage them, trying to convincing them of the dangers of jumping, using a thousand explanations. -""And what if what they say is true?"" Wondered the young naru. -""Don't' worry. why do the talk so much about a leap they've never done? I too am a bit scared, but it doesn't look so difficult,"" Replied ariki, ever determined. -""But if it goes wrong, it would be a terrible end,"" Continued naru, undecided. -""Perhaps the jump will go badly, and perhaps not. but staying forever on this side of the island surely won't work out well either. do you know of anyone whose death did not come from being either eaten by the wild beasts or from famine? that too is a terrible end, although it still seems far away to us."" -""You're right, ariki. and if we wait much longer we won't have the strength to make the leap … let's do it tomorrow.""And on the next day, naru and ariki jumped to the good side of the island. When taking up the poles, taking their run up, while feeling their desire, the fear hardly allowed them to breathe. And while flying through the air, helpless and without support, they felt that something surely must have gone wrong and certain death awaited them.

179,"There were once - a long, long, very long time ago; so long ago that not even day and night existed, and upon the earth there lived only strange and magic creatures - two little elves who dreamed of jumping so high that they could manage to capture the clouds. One day, the great sky fairy saw them jumping again and again, in what seemed to be some useless but amusing game. They were trying to capture a few light clouds that were passing by at great speed. Their game so amused the sky fairy that she decided to grant each of the elves a wish. -""What would you most like in life? only one thing though, I can't give you more,"" She asked of the elf who seemed the most restless. The elf, excited at talking to one of the great fairies, and anxious to receive his wish, answered instantly. -""To jump! I want to be able to jump right over the mountains! above the clouds and the wind, and beyond the sun!"" -""Are you sure?"" Said the fairy ""You don't want anything else?""The little elf, impatient, spoke of the years he had spent dreaming of having such an ability, and he assured the fairy that nothing could make him happier. The fairy, convinced, blew onto the elf and the elf instantly jumped so high that within moments he had soared through the clouds. Then he continued on towards the sun and, finally, they lost sight of him as he made his way to the stars. Then the fairy turned to the other elf. -""And you? what is it that you most want?""The second elf, who was a bit quieter than the first elf, went into deep thought. He scratched his chin, pulled at his ears, looked up at the sky, looked at the ground, looked again at the sky, rubbed his eyes, put a hand on his ear, looked again at the ground, put on a sad face, and finally answered:   -""I want to be able to catch anything, above all so I can break my friend's fall. otherwise he'll die when he comes plummeting back to earth.""At that moment they began hearing a noise, like a far off little cry, and it was coming closer and closer, becoming louder and louder. Then they could clearly make out the horrified face of the first elf, who was fully expecting to soon experience the biggest crash-landing in history.

182,"Once upon a time, in a small city, there was an empty storybook. The book looked great, with an impressive cover, but all its pages were blank. Children and grown-ups would pick up the book with anticipation, but finding no stories inside, they would cast the book aside. Not far from there, a lovely inkwell had been full of ink for years. His owner had forgotten about it, and left it away in some corner. The inkwell and the storybook cursed their bad luck, and so they spent their days. Fortune had it that one time when the book was thrown away he ended up next to the inkwell. For days and days the two of them swapped stories about their bad luck, and they could have carried on for years, if an elegant swan feather had not floated down and landed next to them. Having fallen from his swan, the feather felt lonely and abandoned for the first time in his life. He cried and cried, and the book and the inkwell joined in, letting out all their sadness at the years of neglect. However, unlike his companions, the feather soon tired of crying, and he resolved to improve the situation. Drying his tears, and leaving his complaints behind, he clearly saw how the three of them, working together, could achieve a lot more than just suffering. He convinced his friends to write a story. The storybook opened up his best pages, the inkwell didn't spill even a drop, and the feather contributed great ingenuity and beautiful writing.

185,"Everyone knows that the history of our planet changed forever some time after the beijing olympic games. The world's coasts and seas filled up with a very dangerous and polluting species of creature, which looked like a squid, but was called a ""Squidge"". The squidges were everywhere, and impossible to catch. But the worst aspect of it was that they were filling up the seas with oil, tins, paper, and all kinds of rubbish. It was a terrible situation; the whole planet was quickly contaminated, and advanced investigation teams and hunting expeditions were set up to try to deal with this new plague. But no one could even get close to catching a squidge. Finally, the first person to manage it was a boy called caesar tiddler. Caesar lived in a small fishing village, and when he held up his squidge at a press conference, he became the most famous boy in the world. That small fishing village was overrun by scientists and government investigators, who came from all over the planet to study the species. Everything was prepared for a post mortem to be done on the squidge, an operation that would be watched on live television around the world. So imagine the amazement when, on cutting the squidge open, a tiny space ship the size of a shoe was found inside, and inside that space ship were some martians. Now, these martians turned out to be quite charming, amusing, and clever little chaps. Before long, they were busy talking to governments, who were all very angry at the way the martians had been messing up the planet. The governments expected some kind of explanation for the martians having behaved in such an uncivilised fashion…   -""We came from a planet that was going to be destroyed,"" The martians began to explain. -""We liked the earth so much that we spent many days spying on how you human beings behave. we thought that would help us to blend in if we came here, and it would help us all get along happily together. that's why, after seeing you dump tins, paper, and oil, we invented some expensive machines to do just that. we hid them inside the disguise of a squid, and we tried to live happily there, in peace. are you all happy? can we stay here? finallllyyyyy?""The martian squidge-men waited for an answer. But no one uttered a word. Everyone, including the billions watching on tv, were red with embarrassment, remembering the last time they had thrown away a piece of paper, or their car had leaked some oil on the road.

186,"This is the incredible tale of a very odd boy. He always wanted what wasn't his: his friends' toys, his cousins' clothes, his parents' books…he ended up being so envious that even the hairs on his head were given to jealousy. One day, it just so happened that a hair on the crown of his head woke up completely green. Now, when the other hairs saw this they became so hugely envious that they too ended up turning green. The next day, a hair near his hairline was stained by something blue. Seeing this, again all the other hairs ended up blue. So, day after day, the boy's hair would completely change colour, driven by the boundless envy his hairs felt. Everyone loved the boy's colourful and ever-changing hair; except the boy himself. He always wanted what other people had, so, of course, he wanted to have hair just like the others had. One day, this angered him so much that he furiously pulled at his hair. One rather thin hair couldn't endure all the pulling, and it let go; falling to the floor with quite a nice smooth flight. Of course, the other hairs saw this, felt envious, and they all let go too. Within a minute the boy was as bald as an egg, and the look of surprise on his face seemed like a bad joke. After many tears and tantrums, the boy understood how all this had happened, and how it had all been a natural consequence of his envy. He decided that, from then on, he would try to enjoy what he had, without becoming obsessed by what others had. Trying to put this into practice he started by making the most of his smooth, shiny, hairless head. He turned it into his own private canvas. From that day on, he took to painting beautiful, colourful scenes on his bald head.

Yet on exam day he even messed only thing he was trying to remember for long. Upon hearing all people in class started to laugh at him and everybody said that old man couldn't learn reading or writing at this age. This incident broke shikaki and he left school and went toward jungle. By chance, he reached the foot of a mountain, there he saw water falling drop by drop from top and due to continues falling of water on same place, a hole had been formed even in that hard stone.

Young man told him that his father has died and he wants to perform best after life rituals for his father and despite of his father's good or bad actions in his life, he wants his father's soul to go to heaven. He said, ""I could have gone to any ordinary priest but I have come to you with this request. I want you to perform after life ritual for him so that in his after life he can gain entry to heaven and permanently resides there.""Buddha listened to man and said, ""Go to market and buy two earthen pots. also bring some butter and some pebbles to fill in the pot.""Young man went to market and bought them, thinking that this was for ritual. Then young man filled one pot with butter and another with pebbles and sealed them. Buddha them told him to put them in a near by pond. Young boy did as said and both pots sank to the bottom of pond. Now buddha asked him to bring a stout stick and strike both pots and break them open. He did so, thinking that now the buddha would perform a wonderful ritual for his father. As young man hit pots and break them open, the butter escaped from first and floated to the surface where as stones from other pot settled at bottom. Buddha said, ""I have done this much. now call all your priest. let them come and pray  'oh pebbles, rise to the surface.. oh butter, sink to bottom..'young man replied, ""Are you joking?

253,"Once upon a time, in a kingdom lived a priest who had magical power and knew a special spell which was given to him by his teacher. There was a condition on use of that special spell that it can be used only once a year at a specific time. Priest had a disciple who was a very good student and was intelligent and able to understand his teacher even most difficult lessons. He was obedient and faithful and always wishing to honor and protect his teacher. One day priest had to go on a trip faraway from village. Since trip was long and he had to pass through dangerous road, he asked his disciple to come with him. Both priest and his disciple were going on their trip and along this road, they were attacked and kidnapped by a gang. Gang demanded 5000 gold coins to release him. So, priest sent his disciple to get them from his village. Before leaving disciple knelt before priest and bowed respectfully. He said to him in low voice, ""Master, tonight is night when you can use your special spell once a year but please do not use this spell. I will come back with ransom money. please bear till then.""After disciple left. In evening, kidnappers tied up priest tightly and left him and outside their cave for night and gave him nothing to eat and drink. At night moon came out. Priest was in pain. He looked at and saw lining up of planet and knew that this is time his spell could work. He thought to himself, ""Why should I suffer like this when I can pay my own ransom using my magical spell. my life is much more worth than jewels.besides this lucky night comes only once a year. I can not waste this cane to use my great power.""Priest decided to use the spell. He called out kidnappers and said, ""I can make you rich beyond your wildest dream. for I am great and powerful. you must trust me and untie me. treat me properly, let me wash my head and face and dress me in new clothes. then after honoring me properly, leave me alone to do my magic.""Kidnappers wanted money so they agreed and did as said. But they didn't trust him completely, they hid in bushes and secretly watched him. They saw that. Priest looked up into sky and calculated that planets were lined up in special pattern then he lowered his head and muttered a spell into his hands and then gazed up into sky and clapped his hands. Suddenly he was showered with the most beautiful jewels from sky. Seeing such beautiful jewels, kidnappers came out of hiding and grabbed all precious stones. They thought that if priest can give them so much jewels why leave him. They tied him up again and took him with them. On way they were stopped by another gang of robbers. That gang demanded money from them. Kidnappers were less in number. They knew they couldn't win against them so they bring priest to them and said, ""Leave us alone and you can get all the riches from this priest. he knows a magical spell with which he can make precious jewels shower. he can do this for you also.""Priest replied, ""Of course I can give but now you have to wait for another year as I can do this spell only once a year. you can come see me next year and I will give you all the jewels I get at that time.""Robbers didn't believe him and angrily said, ""You tricky priest you are lying. you made kidnapper gang wealthy but now refusing to do same for us.""Saying this they killed priest. Then they attacked kidnapper gang for jewels and killed them all. After getting jewels robbers started to fight between them and in bloody battle all died.

260,"Once in a village lived tow brothers arun and varun who used to live together. One day they got in a fight and decided to divide everything. Arun was elder and cunning where as varun was simple minded. After all things were divided. Brothers were left with blanket, cow and mango tree to be divided. Seeing this arun said,""My brother, I will have blanket during night time, you can have it during day time..as for cow, I will have the back end of cow and you can have the front end to cow..and about tree, I will take care of the upper half of tree and you can take the lower half of tree.""Varun who was simple minded agreed to his brother's term.

Mother continued, ""When people praise arun, you don't like it. when he loss, you feel happy. whatever he does, you feel compelled to do it all. you keep seeing negative qualities in him and feel a sense of dislike towards him. you feel like telling others about his negatives. you burn like fire all day long. tell me, do you feel all of this?""Karan was stunned with what he heard and said, ""It's true but how did you know about this??""Mother replied, ""Your gloomy face shows it all but I have a great solution for you to overcome jealousy..""Karan replied, ""What is it?? please tell me..""Mother replied, ""When you heartily appreciate the positive qualities in others, those qualities manifest in you. our strength increases and by heartily accepting the positive in others, our jealousy for the person dissolves completely. therefore, you too should appreciate the positive qualities in arun from the bottom of your heart.""Just listening to this karan replied with grumpy face, ""Positives qualities?? in arun?? even if search I cannot find even a single positive quality in him..""Mother rhetorically asked, ""You can't or you don't want to find?""Karan looked down speechlessly. Mother said, ""Ok.. tell me when do you start preparing for exam?""Karan replied, ""A week before..""Mother asked, ""And arun??""Karan thought and replied, ""He studies daily. once his father told me that arun always follows his timetable. he has slotted aside time to watch tv, play and chat with friends and he diligently follows the timetable.""Mother replied, ""So.. this is known was good management skills and this proves that he is sincere and hardworking..""Karan nodded in yes. Mother than said, ""Instead of being jealous, if you appreciate his positive qualities then these qualities will also begin to develop in you.""Karan felt inspired and following that day, he remembered his mother's teaching. He began to notice and appreciate arun's discipline, sincerity, concentration, hard working qualities. Within no time, he also became sincere and hard working like arun. Exam results were declared. Karan went home to mother and looked very happy. Mother smiled and said, ""What's matter? you look very happy today..!!""Karan replied, ""Yes.. I got results today. arun again stood first while I came second. best part is today I am not jealous of him at all. I am happy to see my progress and at same time I am happy with his,""Karan continued, ""Thank you.. you have given me the ultimate solution to overcome jealousy. all my energies were lost being jealous. now, I can steer my strengths onto the path of progress.""Mother was happy and hugged karan and congratulated him on his good work and progress.

265,"Once near a pond was a very big tree. There lived a big group of swans. In that group lived an old swan who was very wise, intelligent and far-sighted. Everyone around respected him. One day, old swan saw a small vine wrapped at the bottom of tree trunk. He called other swans and said, ""We should destroy this vine or one day it will take us to our death.""Everyone laughed and said, ""How can this little vine hurt us??""Old swan explained, ""Today, it seems little but with time it will become thick and strong and will be wrapped up all around tree trunk and would be so thick that hunter could climb on tree using this vine as stairs..""Other swan could believe and said, ""But it's so small, how can this small vine form a ladder?""One of them said, ""You are worrying too much.. this small vine can not harm us ever.."". Other said, ""You are just now making up stories to prove that whatever you say is right..!!""Saying this everyone ignored his warning and kept on enjoying life.

268,"Once a pregnant lion died soon after giving birth. New born cub didn't know what to do. Cub started to roam around just when it saw a herd of sheep. Seeing that little cub, mother sheep decided to raise it as its own. With time, that little cub grew up along with sheep and started to think and act just like a sheep. It would even eat grass like sheep. Lion was teased by other sheep for being so different. Some of them would say, ""You are so ugly. your voice is so weird. you are disgrace to sheep family.""Lion felt sad that he didn't looked like them and that something was missing. Lion tired to get along with sheep herd but still it felt that he had let down the sheep community by being so different and that it was a waste of space. One day, an older lion saw herd of sheep and decided to attack it. While attacking, it saw the young lion running away along with the other sheep. Older lion got curious and decided to pursue younger lion. Soon it was able to pounce on young lion and then asked, ""Why are you running away with sheep?""Younger lion who had never seen lion, shaking in fear it said, ""Please don't eat me. I am just a young sheep, please let me go..!!""Hearing this, older lion growls, ""What?? you are not a sheep.. you are a lion just like me..""Young lion just kept on saying, ""I am sheep.. please let me go..""At this point the older lion gets an idea.

Unfortunately one day even though he didn't wanted to kill her, wife succumbed to his beating and died. When he realized what happened he became fearful of wife's relatives and thought of consequences. Just thought of what his relative would do to him, he shivered with fear. In state of anxiety he went out to met one of his acquaintance and told him about his problem and asked him for solution. That acquaintance instead of reporting him to police or telling him to go to police and admit his crime, gave him an idea. He told him that - he should invite an young man to his house and behead him then put that young man's head beside his wife body and tell all his relatives that as he reached home, he found both of them in bed and killed both of them because he was unable to control his anger. Man liked the idea and went back to his home. He hid her wife body in his room and then went out. As he was passing by his street he met a young man. He talked him into coming to his house. Young man agreed and walked to his home with him. He poisoned him and then beheaded him. He did as his acquaintance has suggested him to do. Later he called all his wife's relatives and told them story he made-up to cover his crime. Listening to his story relative couldn't blame him and all left. His relatives went away but his acquaintance who devised plan had a teenage son who didn't came home last night. He was worried.

With left hundred coins he organized a music and dance concert for everyone. Next day birbal entered akbar's court and announced that the king had asked his brother-in-law to do. Birbal told him about all the events. Akbar asked him to explain. Birbal replied, ""The money I gave to the merchant for the wedding of his son - you have got back while on this earth. the money I spent on buying food and clothing for the poor - you will get it in the other world. the money I spent on the musical concert - you will get neither here nor there.""Akbar's new minister understood his mistake and resigned to give birbal his place back.

She stayed away from tiger but in her heart she knew that one day she have to come closer to get it's whisker. Another month went by and now tiger would sat beside empty bowl waiting for her to come.

Not a week later, tiger allowed her to gently rub it's head and as she rubbed it's head, tiger would purr and stretch like a house cat. She went back home and that night she knew that time had come. Next morning she brought a knife and also took a fresh bowl of rice to tiger's cave. She placed the rice bowl and said to tiger, ""May I please have just one of your whiskers??""Tiger nodded and while petting its head, she carved whisker off tiger's head. She thanked tiger and left.

Kim replied, ""Yes..""Hermit checked the whisker, it was indeed tiger's whisker. ""Tell me.. how did you do it??"", said hermit. Kim told him about the story that how she earned tiger's trust and when she requested, tiger permitted her to cut off one off it's whisker. After listening to kim story, hermit took the whisker and flicked it into fire and said, ""Kim.. you no longer need the whisker.. tell me, what's more vicious.. a tiger or a man?? if a dangerous wild beat respond to you gradual patient care.. don't you think a man will respond??""Kim stood speechless and then returned to her..

Seeing its condition holy man asked, ""What happened to you??""Snake replied, ""After I promised not to bite anyone. soon villagers started to attack me and I had to hid myself under the rock to keep myself safe from their attacks. why is this happening to me??""Holy man stood silently and then in low voice replied, ""You are such a fool! you don't know how to protect yourself. I asked you not to bite but I didn't forbid you to hiss. why didn't you scare them by hissing?""Snake understood his mistake and slithered away hissing.

[SEP] Never judge a person by how he speaks.","It's story of a boy who has just finished his college and hadn't had got any job yet and was living in a small rented room. One day his cousin came to him and asked him to help with some concepts. Boy had good hold of knowledge over that subject so boy helped his cousin without any difficulty. Soon boy by joined by some more friends for help in studies and were also willing to pay him fee for teaching them. However, house owner was not happy with all the crowd coming to his house. So he asked boy to leave that rented room or look for some place to continue his teaching activities. Boy really wanted to continue teaching as he loved that and also helped him to earn some money so he looked for another place to teach his students. By luck he found out a place. It was a big hall where a saint used to live alone. Boy went to saint and asked him for permission to use that hall for teaching his students. Saint agreed and allow him to take classes in the corner of that hall but on one condition. Saint asked him to pay rent of rs 100 every month in advance. Boy was surprised to know that saint asked him to pay rent for using his place for teaching. 100rs was quiet big amount at that time but still boy agreed as he was happy to have a place to teach his students and managed to pay first month rent in advance. Once classes started some more students joined. As months passed by boy continued teaching there but one thing bothered him that saint was very strict about rent to be paid in advance. Saint used to remind him about paying rent on 30th or 31st date so that he doesn't delay paying rent in advance. Boy had seen saint used to live very simple life and even during class time saint's presence never disturbed boy's class. Classes continued for a year but after a year boy got a good job in another place and had to stop taking classes. On last day boy told saint about leaving and he saw that saint was sad  to hear that.

320,"Long-era ago, in india lived a boy named eklavya, son of tribal chief in the forest of kingdom hastinapur. Eklavya was brave and handsome boy who was loved by all. His father saw that something was troubling him. Many times he saw his son lost in deep thought and other boys used to play and hunt for pleasure. One day father asked his son, ""Why are you so unhappy? why don't you play with your friends?""""I want to be a archer. I want to be a disciple of the great guru dronacharya, the greatest tutor of archery in hastinapur. his gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors."", he replied. ""I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. so please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya."", he addedhis father knew it not going to be easy for him but he didnot want to refuse the only wish of his son. So, father gave his blessings. Eklavya set on his way to reach part of forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. When boy reached drona's gurukul and saw it was consisted of several huts surrounded by treesand an archery yard. There he saw a man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. ""Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura."" Eklavya replied. ""Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery.""Drona sighed. ""Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy"" He said. The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona's refusal to teach him. ""It's not fair!"" He thought miserably. ""God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind."" He left the place with a broken heart but it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery. ""I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?"" Thought he. ""I am as strong and zealous as drona's princes and disciples. if I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer.""Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired several arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog's mouth without injuring it. As a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. As fate would have it, that day, drona was instructing prince about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the ""Stuffed"" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. "" Such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer."" He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. Drona said,""Your aim is truly remarkable! from whom did you learn archery?"" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona's praises. How surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact was his guru! ""From you my master. you are my guru,"" Eklavya replied humbly. ""Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!"" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. "" Now I remember,"" Said he. ""Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""""Yes, dronacharya"", replied the boy. ""After I left your gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer.""Hearing this, arjuna became angry. ""But you promised me that you'd make me the best archer in the world!"" He accused drona. ""Now how can that be? now a common hunter has become better than me!"" The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna's question, drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish eklavya. ""Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training,"" The sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. ""Dronacharya, I'll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina ""He said. ""I might ask something you don't like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?"" Drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru's dakshina was refused. ""No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I'll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya,"" Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. ""Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina"" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. ""Ok gurudev, as you wish."" Said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb! The princes gasped at eklavya's act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. ""Here is my guru dakshina, drona"", ekalavya said. ""I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I'm a mere shudra hunter.""The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. ""Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you'll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,"" Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona's blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of mahabharatha. [SEP] With your dedication and determination to learn something you can do anything you want.. ! !","Long-era ago, in india lived a boy named eklavya, son of tribal chief in the forest of kingdom hastinapur. Eklavya was brave and handsome boy who was loved by all. His father saw that something was troubling him. Many times he saw his son lost in deep thought and other boys used to play and hunt for pleasure. One day father asked his son, ""Why are you so unhappy? why don't you play with your friends?""""I want to be a archer. I want to be a disciple of the great guru dronacharya, the greatest tutor of archery in hastinapur. his gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors."", he replied. ""I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. so please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya."", he addedhis father knew it not going to be easy for him but he didnot want to refuse the only wish of his son. So, father gave his blessings. Eklavya set on his way to reach part of forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. When boy reached drona's gurukul and saw it was consisted of several huts surrounded by treesand an archery yard. There he saw a man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. ""Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura."" Eklavya replied. ""Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery.""Drona sighed. ""Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy"" He said. The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona's refusal to teach him. ""It's not fair!"" He thought miserably. ""God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind."" He left the place with a broken heart but it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery. ""I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?"" Thought he. ""I am as strong and zealous as drona's princes and disciples. if I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer.""Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired several arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog's mouth without injuring it. As a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. As fate would have it, that day, drona was instructing prince about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the ""Stuffed"" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. "" Such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer."" He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. Drona said,""Your aim is truly remarkable! from whom did you learn archery?"" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona's praises. How surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact was his guru! ""From you my master. you are my guru,"" Eklavya replied humbly. ""Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!"" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. "" Now I remember,"" Said he. ""Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""""Yes, dronacharya"", replied the boy. ""After I left your gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer.""Hearing this, arjuna became angry. ""But you promised me that you'd make me the best archer in the world!"" He accused drona. ""Now how can that be? now a common hunter has become better than me!"" The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna's question, drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish eklavya. ""Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training,"" The sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. ""Dronacharya, I'll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina ""He said. ""I might ask something you don't like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?"" Drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru's dakshina was refused. ""No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I'll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya,"" Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. ""Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina"" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy?

""I might ask something you don't like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?"" Drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru's dakshina was refused. ""No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I'll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya,"" Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. ""Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina"" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. ""Ok gurudev, as you wish."" Said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb! The princes gasped at eklavya's act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. ""Here is my guru dakshina, drona"", ekalavya said. ""I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I'm a mere shudra hunter.""The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. ""Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you'll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,"" Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona's blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of mahabharatha.

The king was very pleased to see that the painter has made a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding the king's disabilities. The king gave him a great reward.

337,"Once upon a time shree krishna and arjun went for a short stroll around the city. They saw a poor looking priest begging. Arjun felt pity at him and he gave him a bag full of 100 gold coins. The priest became very happy and thanked arjun. He left for his home. On way, he saw another person who needed help. The priest could have spared a coin or two to help that person. However, he chose to ignore it. But on way to his home, one thief robbed him of his bag of coins and ran away. The priest became dejected and went back again for begging. Next day again when arjun saw the same priest begging and he was surprised that after getting a bag full of coins which can last a lifetime, the priest was still begging! He called the priest and asked him the reason for this. The priest told him about the whole incident and arjun again felt pity at him. So, this time he gave him a diamond. The priest became very happy and left for home and he again saw someone who needed help but he chose to ignore again. Upon reaching home, he safely put the diamond in an empty pot of water with a plan to cash it out later and live a wealthy life. His wife was not at home. He was very tired so he decided to take a nap. In between, his wife came home and picked up that empty pot of water, walked towards the river close by to fill up the water. She had not noticed the diamond in the pot. Upon arriving at the river, she put the whole pot into the running river water to fill it up. She filled up the pot but the diamond was gone with the water flow! When the priest woke up, he went to see the pot and asked his wife about the diamond. She told him, she had not noticed it and it must have been lost in the river. The priest couldn't believe his bad luck and again started begging. Again arjun and shree krishna saw him begging and arjun inquired about it. Arjun felt bad and started thinking if this priest will ever have a happy life. Shree krishna who is an incarnation of god smiled. Shree krishna gave that priest one coin which was not even enough for buying a lunch or dinner for one person.

Shree krishna smiled and told arjun to follow that priest and find out. On the way, the priest was thinking that one coin shree krishna gave him, he can't even buy a lunch for one person. Why would he give so little? He saw a fisherman who was getting a fish out of his net. Fish was struggling. The priest felt pity at fish. He thought that this one coin won't solve my problem, why not I save that fish. So the priest paid the fisherman and took the fish. He put the fish in his small pot of water which he always carried with him. The fish was struggling in a small pot of water, ended up throwing out a diamond from the mouth!

One fine day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had traveled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed. The crocodile returned the next day. And the next. And the next one after that. Soon the two became very good friends. They discussed their lives, their friends and family, like all friends do. The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife. The crocodile's wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day. Meanwhile, the friendship between the monkey and the crocodile deepened as they spent more and more time together. The crocodile's wife started getting jealous. She wanted to put an end to this friendship. So she pretended that she could not believe that her husband could be friends with a monkey. Her husband tried to convince her that he and the monkey shared a true friendship. The crocodile's wife thought to herself that if the monkey lived on a diet of rose monkeys, his flesh would be very sweet. So she asked the crocodile to invite the monkey to their house. The crocodile was not happy about this. He tried to make the excuse that it would be difficult to get the monkey across the river. But his wife was determined to eat the monkey's flesh. So she thought of a plan. One day, she pretended to be very ill and told the crocodile that the doctor said that she would only recover if she ate a monkey's heart.

344,"Once upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself. Each day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd. Then one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother. He took her to mount candorana to live in a cave beside a beautiful lake that was covered by gorgeous pink lotuses. It so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out. On seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out. The elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to benaras. On reaching the city, he heard that king brahmadutta's personal elephant had just died and the king was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a king should come forward with the information. The forester was very excited and immediately went up to the king and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on mount candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant. The king was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother's meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the king's men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to benaras and then request the benevolent king to be set free. That night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the king's men had taken away her son. She was scared that the king would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly. Meanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent. The worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their king, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The king was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his king. But the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the king asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on mount candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die. The compassionate king was touched by the elephant's story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness. The happy elephant went running home as fast as he could. And he was relieved to find that his mother was still alive. He filled his trunk with water and poured it over his sick mother who thought that it was raining. Then she cried out as she thought that some evil spirit had come to harm her and wished and prayed that her son was there to save her. The white elephant gently bent over his blind mother and stroked her lovingly. She immediately recognized his touch and was overjoyed. Her son lifted her up and told her that the kind and compassionate king of benaras had set him free and he was here to love and look after his mother forever. His mother was absolutely thrilled and blessed the kind king with peace, prosperity and joy till the end of his days. She was so thankful to him for sending her son back home.

[SEP] Pride goes before fall.","Once upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself. Each day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd. Then one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother. He took her to mount candorana to live in a cave beside a beautiful lake that was covered by gorgeous pink lotuses. It so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out. On seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out. The elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to benaras. On reaching the city, he heard that king brahmadutta's personal elephant had just died and the king was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a king should come forward with the information. The forester was very excited and immediately went up to the king and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on mount candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant. The king was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother's meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the king's men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to benaras and then request the benevolent king to be set free. That night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the king's men had taken away her son. She was scared that the king would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly. Meanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent. The worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their king, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The king was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his king. But the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the king asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on mount candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die. The compassionate king was touched by the elephant's story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness. The happy elephant went running home as fast as he could. And he was relieved to find that his mother was still alive. He filled his trunk with water and poured it over his sick mother who thought that it was raining. Then she cried out as she thought that some evil spirit had come to harm her and wished and prayed that her son was there to save her. The white elephant gently bent over his blind mother and stroked her lovingly. She immediately recognized his touch and was overjoyed. Her son lifted her up and told her that the kind and compassionate king of benaras had set him free and he was here to love and look after his mother forever.

347,"This is the story of a long-gone era. In the country of india, nearly five thousand years back, lived a boy named eklavya, the son of a tribal chief in the forests of the kingdom- hastinapura. Eklavya was a brave, handsome boy. He was loved by all. But he was not happy. His father saw that something troubled eklavya. More than once he found his son lost deep in thought when other boys enjoyed the pleasures of hunting and playing. One day the father asked his son, why are you so unhappy, eklavya? Why don t you join your friends? Why are you not interested in hunting? Father, I want to be an archer replied eklavya, I want to become a disciple of the great dronacharya, the great tutor of archery in hastinapura. His gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors. Eklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, father, I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya.  eklavya's father was troubled, for he knew that his son's ambition was not an easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his only son's wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way to drona s gurukul.  eklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. In those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or hostel. The only place where one could get some education was a gurukul. A gurukul  is a type of ancient hindu school in india that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective of their social standing. The students learned from the guru and also helped the guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such as washing clothes, cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome one. Having said this much, let us now return to eklavya. When the boy reached dronacharya s gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts,  surrounded by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But eklavya s eyes searched drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without drona, all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. But all his worries soon subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third pandava prince arjuna, as eklavya came to know later. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. ""Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura."" Eklavya replied. ""Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery.""Drona sighed. ""Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy"" He said. ""And he's also a royal teacher,"" Interrupted prince arjuna. ""Our guru has been appointed by the king to train us, the princes and the highborn. how dare you come inside the gurukul and seek him? leave! now!"" He spat out, looking enraged that eklavya had disturbed his practice. Eklavya was stunned at arjuna's behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way. He looked at drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was loud and clear. Dronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him.  the innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona's refusal to teach him. ""It's not fair!"" He thought miserably. ""God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind.""He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. But it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery.  ""I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?"" Thought he. "" I am as strong and zealous as drona's princes and disciples. if I practice the art every day, I can surely become an archer.""Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to drona's best pupil, arjuna. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy ignored the dog, but the continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking.  before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog's mouth without injuring it. As a result, it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. But eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just some distance away, the pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, drona, who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the ""Stuffed"" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. ""  such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer."" He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. ""Your aim is truly remarkable!"" Drona praised eklavya, and asked, ""From whom did you learn archery?"" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona's praises.  how surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact, was his guru! ""From you my master.  you are my guru,"" Eklavya replied humbly. ""Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!"" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. ""  now I remember,"" Said he. ""Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""""Yes, dronacharya"", replied the boy. ""After I left your gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer.""Hearing this, arjuna became angry. ""But you promised me that you'd make me the best archer in the world!"" He accused drona. ""Now how can that be? now a common hunter has become better than me!""The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna's question, drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish eklavya.  ""Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training,"" The sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina was the voluntary fee or gift offered by a disciple to his guru at the end of his training. The guru-shishya parampara, I. E. The teacher-student tradition, was a hallowed tradition in hinduism. At the end of a shishya's study, the guru asks for a ""Guru dakshina,"" Since a guru does not take fees. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. ""Dronacharya, I'll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina ""He said. ""I might ask something you don't like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?""  drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru's dakshina was refused. ""No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful.  I'll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya,"" Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. ""Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina"" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb, he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. ""Ok gurudev as you wish"", said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb!  the prince gasped at eklavya's act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. ""Here is my guru dakshina, drona"", ekalavya said. ""I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I'm a mere shudra hunter.""The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. ""Eklavya, even without your thumb, you'll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,"" Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona's blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of mahabharata.

In the country of india, nearly five thousand years back, lived a boy named eklavya, the son of a tribal chief in the forests of the kingdom- hastinapura. Eklavya was a brave, handsome boy. He was loved by all. But he was not happy. His father saw that something troubled eklavya. More than once he found his son lost deep in thought when other boys enjoyed the pleasures of hunting and playing. One day the father asked his son, why are you so unhappy, eklavya? Why don t you join your friends? Why are you not interested in hunting? Father, I want to be an archer replied eklavya, I want to become a disciple of the great dronacharya, the great tutor of archery in hastinapura. His gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors. Eklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, father, I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya.  eklavya's father was troubled, for he knew that his son's ambition was not an easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his only son's wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way to drona s gurukul.  eklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. In those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or hostel. The only place where one could get some education was a gurukul. A gurukul  is a type of ancient hindu school in india that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective of their social standing. The students learned from the guru and also helped the guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such as washing clothes, cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome one. Having said this much, let us now return to eklavya. When the boy reached dronacharya s gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts,  surrounded by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But eklavya s eyes searched drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without drona, all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. But all his worries soon subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third pandava prince arjuna, as eklavya came to know later. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. ""Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura."" Eklavya replied. ""Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery.""Drona sighed. ""Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy"" He said. ""And he's also a royal teacher,"" Interrupted prince arjuna. ""Our guru has been appointed by the king to train us, the princes and the highborn. how dare you come inside the gurukul and seek him? leave! now!"" He spat out, looking enraged that eklavya had disturbed his practice. Eklavya was stunned at arjuna's behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way. He looked at drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was loud and clear. Dronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him.  the innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona's refusal to teach him. ""It's not fair!"" He thought miserably. ""God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind.""He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. But it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery.  ""I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?"" Thought he. "" I am as strong and zealous as drona's princes and disciples. if I practice the art every day, I can surely become an archer.""Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to drona's best pupil, arjuna. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy ignored the dog, but the continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking.  before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog's mouth without injuring it. As a result, it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. But eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just some distance away, the pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, drona, who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the ""Stuffed"" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. ""  such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer."" He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. ""Your aim is truly remarkable!"" Drona praised eklavya, and asked, ""From whom did you learn archery?"" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona's praises.  how surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact, was his guru! ""From you my master.  you are my guru,"" Eklavya replied humbly. ""Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!"" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. ""  now I remember,"" Said he. ""Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""""Yes, dronacharya"", replied the boy.

Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to drona's best pupil, arjuna. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy ignored the dog, but the continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking.  before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog's mouth without injuring it. As a result, it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. But eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just some distance away, the pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, drona, who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the ""Stuffed"" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. ""  such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer."" He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. ""Your aim is truly remarkable!"" Drona praised eklavya, and asked, ""From whom did you learn archery?"" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona's praises.  how surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact, was his guru! ""From you my master.  you are my guru,"" Eklavya replied humbly. ""Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!"" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. ""  now I remember,"" Said he. ""Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""""Yes, dronacharya"", replied the boy. ""After I left your gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer.""Hearing this, arjuna became angry. ""But you promised me that you'd make me the best archer in the world!"" He accused drona. ""Now how can that be? now a common hunter has become better than me!""The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna's question, drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish eklavya.  ""Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training,"" The sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina was the voluntary fee or gift offered by a disciple to his guru at the end of his training. The guru-shishya parampara, I. E. The teacher-student tradition, was a hallowed tradition in hinduism. At the end of a shishya's study, the guru asks for a ""Guru dakshina,"" Since a guru does not take fees. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. ""Dronacharya, I'll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina ""He said. ""I might ask something you don't like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?""  drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru's dakshina was refused. ""No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful.  I'll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya,"" Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. ""Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina"" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb, he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. ""Ok gurudev as you wish"", said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb!  the prince gasped at eklavya's act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. ""Here is my guru dakshina, drona"", ekalavya said. ""I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I'm a mere shudra hunter.""The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. ""Eklavya, even without your thumb, you'll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,"" Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona's blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of mahabharata. [SEP] Each day is a gift. We should learn to live happy. Happiness comes from inner self and we are one who decides to be happy or not.","This is the story of a long-gone era. In the country of india, nearly five thousand years back, lived a boy named eklavya, the son of a tribal chief in the forests of the kingdom- hastinapura. Eklavya was a brave, handsome boy. He was loved by all. But he was not happy. His father saw that something troubled eklavya. More than once he found his son lost deep in thought when other boys enjoyed the pleasures of hunting and playing. One day the father asked his son, why are you so unhappy, eklavya? Why don t you join your friends? Why are you not interested in hunting? Father, I want to be an archer replied eklavya, I want to become a disciple of the great dronacharya, the great tutor of archery in hastinapura. His gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors. Eklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, father, I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya.  eklavya's father was troubled, for he knew that his son's ambition was not an easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his only son's wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way to drona s gurukul.  eklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. In those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or hostel. The only place where one could get some education was a gurukul. A gurukul  is a type of ancient hindu school in india that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective of their social standing. The students learned from the guru and also helped the guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such as washing clothes, cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome one. Having said this much, let us now return to eklavya. When the boy reached dronacharya s gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts,  surrounded by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But eklavya s eyes searched drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without drona, all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. But all his worries soon subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third pandava prince arjuna, as eklavya came to know later. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. ""Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura."" Eklavya replied. ""Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery.""Drona sighed. ""Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy"" He said. ""And he's also a royal teacher,"" Interrupted prince arjuna. ""Our guru has been appointed by the king to train us, the princes and the highborn. how dare you come inside the gurukul and seek him? leave! now!"" He spat out, looking enraged that eklavya had disturbed his practice. Eklavya was stunned at arjuna's behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way. He looked at drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was loud and clear. Dronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him.  the innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona's refusal to teach him. ""It's not fair!"" He thought miserably. ""God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind.""He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. But it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery.  ""I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?"" Thought he. "" I am as strong and zealous as drona's princes and disciples. if I practice the art every day, I can surely become an archer.""Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice.

351,"One day a man saw an old lady, stranded on the side of the road, but even in the dim light of day, he could see she needed help. So he pulled up in front of her mercedes and got out. His pontiac was still sputtering when he approached her. Even with the smile on his face, she was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. Was he going to hurt her? He didn't look safe; he looked poor and hungry.   he could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. It was those chills which only fear can put in you. He said, ""I'm here to help you, ma'am. why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? by the way, my name is bryan anderson."" Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt.   as he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from st. Louis and was only just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and god knows there were plenty, who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and bryan added, ""And think of me.""He waited until she started her car and drove off. It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt good as he headed for home, disappearing into the twilight. A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home. It was a dingy looking restaurant. Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her. The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered bryan. After the lady finished her meal, she paid with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to get change for her hundred dollar bill, but the old lady had slipped right out the door. She was gone by the time the waitress came back. The waitress wondered where the lady could be. Then she noticed something written on the napkin. There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote: ""You don't owe me anything. I have been there too. somebody once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. if you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: do not let this chain of love end with you.""Under the napkin were four more $100 bills. Well, there were tables to clear, sugar bowls to fill, and people to serve, but the waitress made it through another day. That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it?

He did not have a house. He used to get his meals also with great difficulties. Even his clothes were very much worn out. So, the pundit used to beg for his meals. He went from house-to-house begging. ""Please give me alms"". On seeing his old clothes many people were thinking that he is mad. So, saying ""Go away"" They shut the door. For many days he did not even eat. Once somehow he obtained new clothes. A rich man gave those clothes to the pundit. Wearing those new clothes he went for begging as before. To the very first house he went, the householder said, ""Sir, please come in. please have your food in our house"". Saying thus, with great respect, he took the pundit inside for food.

He decided to lie down in the cave pretending to be ill and then who-so-ever will come to inquire about his health, will become his prey. The old lion put his wicked plan into practice and it started working. Many of his well-wishers got killed. But evil is short lived. One day, a fox came to visit the ailing lion.
