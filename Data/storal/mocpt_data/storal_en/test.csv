They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them. ""What foolishness,"" Cried one, ""To walk when they might as well ride. the most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be.""The miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride. They had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by. ""Oho, what have we here?"" They cried. ""Respect old age, young man! get down, and let the old man ride.""Though the miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the merchants. At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell. ""Look at the old fool,"" Exclaimed one of them. ""Perched on the ass, while that poor boy has to walk.""The miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the boy to climb up behind him. They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. ""What a crime,"" Cried one, ""To load up a poor dumb beast like that! they look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them.""""They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide,"" Said another.

An old wise fox laughed at the tricky fox and said, ""I will also join you after losing my tail when I try to steal the grapes. it looks very nice to be with a tail and I am proud of it."" Now all other faxes understood the trick of the fox and mocked at it. The ashamed fox ran away into the forest. [SEP] Thy pride is but the prologue of thy shame.",2

133,"There was once and incredibly rich, beautiful, and wise princess.

135,"A long, long time ago, when everything was just starting out, and even the planets and stars were so young that they were still going to school, there was a special class which was everyone's favourite, having by far the most fun classmates. The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light. When the sun started shining again, not even that managed to cheer up the world.

[SEP] A fun pirate tale that shows us that everyone, young and old, should enjoy story time.","A long, long time ago, when everything was just starting out, and even the planets and stars were so young that they were still going to school, there was a special class which was everyone's favourite, having by far the most fun classmates. The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light.

""You can hardly call yourselves books. you barely have any writing and are just all pictures"", said one book that had lots and lots of pages written in tiny letters. ""We won't let them put you next to us on the library shelf. you're not real books!"", said another, very serious and fancy book. The poor baby books: they were not even allowed a little corner in bookshops or libraries. They ended up piled up in attics and warehouses. The big books were so happy. Only intelligent people and adults came into bookshops now given that there was nothing interesting for naughty children. The children stayed at the entrance, so the books were no longer scared that they would be manhandled or that their pages would be torn out and dirtied. Years passed and all those children who hadn't visited a library became adults. ""Now they can come in and meet us and admire our wisdom"", thought the big books. But no. The adults who had grown up without baby books had no interest in the big books. They were too long! How were they going to read so many pages all at once, if they had never read anything? The big books were desperate. Bookshops were closing down, libraries looked derelict. Nobody was reading! They all arranged a meeting, they read and read millions of their own pages and discovered that there was only one solution: they had to say sorry to the baby books and get them to come back and put them on the best shelves. That's how they managed to save themselves, by making children read little by little, so that they would grow up to be adults who loved big books. And so that nobody would forget what almost happened, they wrote the story in this baby book, which they give to everybody who thinks that books with few words and loads of pictures aren't real books.

137,"There wasn't a single soul on the beach who hadn't heard of crazyclaws, the formidable enemy of toes and the most feared crab on this side of the ocean. Every year an absent-minded tourist would fall foul of a great big pinch that made them leave and not want to come back. Scared swimmers would often get together to try and catch the crab but every time they thought they had succeeded, the pinches returned to let them know they had caught the wrong crab. Crazyclaws had a mean streak but he was also very clever. Instead of concealing himself and going unnoticed like all the other crabs, he would hide in the sand and prepare his attack. Crazyclaws was a little resentful because, as a baby crab, he was stepped on by a child and had lost a leg. It grew back but it was shorter than his other legs and he got very angry and upset every time he looked at it. He was thinking about how mean swimmers could be when he spotted his next victim. It was a big fat shiny toe and its owner was barely moving. 'how easy! ' he thought. Now he could pinch with all his strength. He remembered the different steps he had to follow: emerge, move forward, pinch, release, retreat, and disappear into the sand again. Go get'em!! Something went wrong, however. Crazyclaws got stuck on the fourth step and was unable to release the toe. His pinch was so strong that he had broken through the skin and got stuck in the flesh. Flesh? It couldn't be, there was no blood. Only then did crazyclaws realise it was a trap! But crazyclaws was exaggerating as always. He thought that no one could be so smart as to trap him with a fake toe. The fake toe did belong to someone though: a girl called vera, who lost her leg in an accident when she was little. She didn't realise that crazyclaws was attached to her toe until she came out of the water to go and play in the sand. She released the crab, but he didn't run off because he was scared to death. Vera discovered that crazyclaws had a shorter leg and she felt sorry for him, so she decided to help him. She made him a wonderful little house using rocks and fetched him small animals to eat. What a feast! This girl sure can look after a crab. She was happy, fun and - most importantly - she put him back in the sea before leaving. ""What a lovely girl"" He thought that night. ""I'd like to be just as nice as her. if only I didn't have this little leg …"". It was at that moment that he realised that vera's leg had never grown back and that children aren't like crabs. They only have two legs and yet she was still really nice. He could certainly be a happy crab even though he had been through very difficult times. The very next day and every day after that during that summer, crazyclaws attacked vera's toe again so he could play with her all day. Together they learned how to turn pinches into tickles and a bad temper into a laughter and glee. In the end, vera's crab became very famous on that beach, though nobody suspected that it was actually crazyclaws. It was better that way because there were still people who had not learnt that you don't need to be resentful and bad tempered, no matter how badly you are pinched by a crab.

""I'd like to be just as nice as her. if only I didn't have this little leg …"". It was at that moment that he realised that vera's leg had never grown back and that children aren't like crabs. They only have two legs and yet she was still really nice. He could certainly be a happy crab even though he had been through very difficult times. The very next day and every day after that during that summer, crazyclaws attacked vera's toe again so he could play with her all day. Together they learned how to turn pinches into tickles and a bad temper into a laughter and glee. In the end, vera's crab became very famous on that beach, though nobody suspected that it was actually crazyclaws. It was better that way because there were still people who had not learnt that you don't need to be resentful and bad tempered, no matter how badly you are pinched by a crab. Translated by ginalda tavares manuel, manchester metropolitan university [SEP] If we thing wisely we can get out of difficult situation. .","There wasn't a single soul on the beach who hadn't heard of crazyclaws, the formidable enemy of toes and the most feared crab on this side of the ocean. Every year an absent-minded tourist would fall foul of a great big pinch that made them leave and not want to come back. Scared swimmers would often get together to try and catch the crab but every time they thought they had succeeded, the pinches returned to let them know they had caught the wrong crab. Crazyclaws had a mean streak but he was also very clever. Instead of concealing himself and going unnoticed like all the other crabs, he would hide in the sand and prepare his attack. Crazyclaws was a little resentful because, as a baby crab, he was stepped on by a child and had lost a leg. It grew back but it was shorter than his other legs and he got very angry and upset every time he looked at it. He was thinking about how mean swimmers could be when he spotted his next victim. It was a big fat shiny toe and its owner was barely moving. 'how easy! ' he thought. Now he could pinch with all his strength. He remembered the different steps he had to follow: emerge, move forward, pinch, release, retreat, and disappear into the sand again. Go get'em!! Something went wrong, however. Crazyclaws got stuck on the fourth step and was unable to release the toe. His pinch was so strong that he had broken through the skin and got stuck in the flesh. Flesh? It couldn't be, there was no blood. Only then did crazyclaws realise it was a trap! But crazyclaws was exaggerating as always. He thought that no one could be so smart as to trap him with a fake toe. The fake toe did belong to someone though: a girl called vera, who lost her leg in an accident when she was little. She didn't realise that crazyclaws was attached to her toe until she came out of the water to go and play in the sand. She released the crab, but he didn't run off because he was scared to death. Vera discovered that crazyclaws had a shorter leg and she felt sorry for him, so she decided to help him. She made him a wonderful little house using rocks and fetched him small animals to eat. What a feast! This girl sure can look after a crab. She was happy, fun and - most importantly - she put him back in the sea before leaving. ""What a lovely girl"" He thought that night.

138,"Of all the warriors in the service of the evil morlan, jerry was the most fierce and the most cruel. His eyes would find the most cautious of enemies, and his bow and arrows would soon finish them off. One day, while plundering a great palace, the warrior found some gleaming, fast-flying arrows that had belonged to the princess there, and he didn't hesitate to take them and put them aside for some special occasion. When those arrows joined the rest of jerry's weapons and learnt of his terrible cruelty they bitterly protested and regretted their new situation.

Arrow by arrow, his hunter's eyes and mind was changing, until the final arrow landed only a few yards from the young princess, from where jerry could see her beauty from close up - the same beauty that he had been about to destroy.

When they were finally ready, they travelled by sea to the island of a thousand deserts, crossed its endless sand dunes, climbed the great rock mountain and finally found the fountain. But the fountain was dry. So dry that they could only fill their wands with a tiny drop of magic. And when the magic of the fountain was drained, the island was transformed into an immense desert that no one could cross. Only two small oases remained and, to give themselves the best chance at survival, iplant and ieat decided to go their separate ways, each to their own tiny oasis. Life then became very hard for both of them. Although the oasis provided them with plenty of water, their only food were the dates from the few palm trees that had grown at the water's edge. Although they waved their wands in an attempt to obtain food, they had so little magic that nothing ever happened. Several weeks later, however, ieat waved his wand and a huge, tasty tomato appeared before him. ""Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today.""And that day was ieat's best since he had gone to live in the oasis. A few days later, something similar happened to iplant, when his wand produced a small potato. ""Lucky me! if I plant the potato and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.""That day, iplant was just as hungry as before but he also had to work to prepare the soil and plant the potato. Sometime later the wand gave ieat a chubby songbird. ""Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today."" The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, iplant's wand gave him a skinny songbird. ""Lucky me! if I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.""For many days after that, iplant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs. Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. Ieat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while iplant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn't take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find ieat to try and cross the desert and escape. However, ieat wanted nothing to do with him. Hearing how iplant had achieved so much and thinking that he could have done the same, he was filled with anger and jealousy.

But the wand had even less magic than the one he already had, and the jealous and impatient magician was stuck in his oasis for years and years, unable to escape. Iplant left ieat's oasis determined to cross the desert. He had only been travelling for a few hours when a strong gust wind dragged his friend, the little bird, away. The wizard ran after him to save him, but the wind turned into a tornado that lifted the little bird, the wizard and all his things, up into the air. They flew and flew for so many hours that they crossed the desert and then crossed the sea.

The young wizard felt the wand and himself fill with the purest magic and the deepest wisdom.

""Lucky me! if I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.""For many days after that, iplant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs. Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. Ieat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while iplant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn't take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find ieat to try and cross the desert and escape. However, ieat wanted nothing to do with him. Hearing how iplant had achieved so much and thinking that he could have done the same, he was filled with anger and jealousy. Convinced that everything was because of the little magic in his own wand, he switched it with iplant's when he wasn't looking. Impatient to try his new wand, he ordered his old friend to leave. But the wand had even less magic than the one he already had, and the jealous and impatient magician was stuck in his oasis for years and years, unable to escape. Iplant left ieat's oasis determined to cross the desert. He had only been travelling for a few hours when a strong gust wind dragged his friend, the little bird, away. The wizard ran after him to save him, but the wind turned into a tornado that lifted the little bird, the wizard and all his things, up into the air. They flew and flew for so many hours that they crossed the desert and then crossed the sea. Finally, the wind dropped and iplant landed softly in a peaceful green valley, next to a beautiful fountain. The bird then took iplant's wand in his beak and carried it to the fountain. The young wizard felt the wand and himself fill with the purest magic and the deepest wisdom. He realised that this was the true fountain of magic and that the bird was its faithful guardian, entrusted with the job of saving such great powers for wizards who had sufficient wisdom, patience and willpower to achieve big things with just a tiny drop of magic. [SEP] Often, we keep looking at the closed door for so long that, we do not even pay attention to good things happening around us. One should learn to forget about past sad experiences and try to give new direction to life.","There were once two young wizard apprentices called iplant and ieat, who trained for years to go and charge their wands in the mysterious fountain of magic. When they were finally ready, they travelled by sea to the island of a thousand deserts, crossed its endless sand dunes, climbed the great rock mountain and finally found the fountain. But the fountain was dry. So dry that they could only fill their wands with a tiny drop of magic. And when the magic of the fountain was drained, the island was transformed into an immense desert that no one could cross. Only two small oases remained and, to give themselves the best chance at survival, iplant and ieat decided to go their separate ways, each to their own tiny oasis. Life then became very hard for both of them. Although the oasis provided them with plenty of water, their only food were the dates from the few palm trees that had grown at the water's edge. Although they waved their wands in an attempt to obtain food, they had so little magic that nothing ever happened. Several weeks later, however, ieat waved his wand and a huge, tasty tomato appeared before him. ""Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today.""And that day was ieat's best since he had gone to live in the oasis. A few days later, something similar happened to iplant, when his wand produced a small potato. ""Lucky me! if I plant the potato and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days.""That day, iplant was just as hungry as before but he also had to work to prepare the soil and plant the potato. Sometime later the wand gave ieat a chubby songbird. ""Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today."" The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, iplant's wand gave him a skinny songbird.

When the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible movement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he started banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got increasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all directions. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with the turtle as the ball. Quite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy it. They laughed non-stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle. The rhino was so furious that he didn't even notice that they were there. On he went, until he had to stop for a second to get his breath. Now that he wasn't bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys, who were making fun of him in every way you can imagine. Neither the rhino, nor the turtle - who had appeared from his shell -, enjoyed the fact that a gang of monkeys was mocking them.

146,"Someone was killing the books. Every day a new book was found open in the library with completely blank pages. No one suspected that the murderer was the evil zepo rete who emptied the books at night with a hoover that sucked up all the letters. Then he carried them stealthily to his lair, where he used an incredible word blender to make a magic juice. In truth, zepo rete had always been bad, but he was also stupid and when he realised that books made people smarter he decided to put them in a blender and drink them, thinking that it would make him cleverer. But books aren't for drinking, nor are they for chewing. They need to be read and when zepo rete started to drink his juice made from books, he filled himself with stories and words that needed to be read. And the words, who were very smart, discovered that they would only be read if they travelled through the body and onto the skin of zepo rete, who was transformed into an enormous tattoo filled with thousands of letters. He used hundreds of soaps and bleaches to try and wash off the words before he realised that the only way to remove them was by reading them. So, even though he didn't want to read a single word, he had little choice and he read his own skin for weeks on end to get rid of all the books he had killed. So, was that the end to the mystery of the book murderer? Far from it! Every morning, even today, a new book is found empty in the library and no one knows why. Have you figured it out? Yes, it is still zepo rete, who continues to hoover up the letters and drink the juice because he discovered that he loved nothing more than reading the books on his skin. Given that he did indeed become smarter, he still empties books every night without getting caught.

150,"Xt-27 wasn't just any robot. His identification plate read ""Xt-27: the best, most modern robot"". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other xt-27s. ""All robots should be like us xt-27s"", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the xt-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself. One day, he was walking along in bionic city, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors. He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an xt-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city's inhabitants were xt-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing! Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an xt-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble , on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn't like. As all the robots were xt-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more. On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time. So xt-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun tp-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another xt-27. So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push… when he woke up, the xt-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The xt-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction.

151,"There was once a little village separated from the sea and its great cliffs by a forest. That forest was the village's best defence against the storms and furies of the sea, that were so ferocious throughout the region that it was only possible to live where the village was. Yet the forest was constantly in danger, because a small group of wicked beings came every night to cut down some of the trees. The villagers could do nothing to stop the felling, so they were forced to constantly plant new trees to replace the fallen ones. And for generations, such was life for the tree planters. Parents taught their children how to plant, and the children, from a very early age, spent all their free time planting new trees. Each family was responsible for replanting a particular area, and had been since time immemorial. Failure of any family to do this would have brought the community to ruin. Of course, most of the planted trees were lost due to a thousand varying reasons, and only a small percentage reached full growth. But so many were planted that the protective forest managed to maintain its size, despite the great storms and the cruel felling of the evil beings. But then, there was a great misfortune. One of the families died out due to lack of descendents, and their area of the forest began losing more trees. There was nothing to be done, the tragedy was inevitable, and in the village the people prepared to emigrate after so many centuries. Even so, one of the young men refused to abandon the village. -""I won't go,"" He said, -""If needed, I will start a new family that will look after that area, and I myself will go to work on it from day one.""Everyone knew that no one was capable of looking after a replanting area all on their own and, as the forest would take some time to thin out, they accepted the young man's proposal. Yet, by doing so, they had accepted the greatest revolution ever seen in the village. That young man, loved by all, had no trouble in finding people to help him replant. But those helping hands all came from other areas, and soon his own area wasn't the only one in need of extra help and more trees. These new areas were helped by other families and soon no one knew whether they should look after their own area or someone else's: so to simplify things they just planted trees wherever they were needed. But they were needed in so many areas that the villagers began planting even during the night, despite their ancestral fear of the wicked tree cutters. Those nocturnal plantings meant the planters came across some of the fellers, only to discover that those ""Wicked"" Beings were nothing more than the frightened members of a tribe that hid themselves in the labyrinthine cliff caves during the day. They would surface at night to get some wood and food, so they could survive. As soon as these ""Beings"" Got to see how good it was living in a village on the surface, having food and water, and knowing how to plant trees, they begged to be accepted into the village. With each new night, the village gained more hands to help with the planting, and there were fewer cave-dwellers cutting down the trees. Soon, the village filled with grateful ""Night-beings"" Who mixed happily among the old families until they became indistinguishable. And so great was their influence, that the forest began to expand. Day after day, year after year, almost imperceptibly, the forest got bigger and bigger, and it provided more and more protection, until finally the descendants from that village could live anywhere they liked in the region.

152,"Once upon a time there was a rich, powerful, and intelligent king. But what was most noticeable about him was his arrogance. Such was his pride that he felt no one was a worthy rival with whom to share his favourite pastime, chess. So the king sent a message across the land, stating that he would give a tenth of his fortune to whoever could prove to be worthy of playing against him. In return, if the king considered that person to be unworthy, he would have their head chopped off. Many risked their lives to challenge the proud king. Rich or poor, stupid or intelligent, the king always found them to be unworthy; they weren't good players, they couldn't match his command of the game. As time passed, one reckless challenger after another was done away with. The king felt satisfied that there was no one in the whole land capable of taking him on. Years later, a poor beggar came to the palace, intending to play against the king. People had tried to dissuade the beggar, trying to save him from a certain death. But it was no good, and he came before the king, who, seeing the beggar's ragged appearance, couldn't believe that it had even crossed the man's mind that he could be a worthy rival. -""What makes you think you deserve to play against someone like myself, slave?"" Said the king, irritated, and calling for the executioner. -""That I forgive you for what you're about to do. would you be capable of that?"" The beggar calmly answered. The king was stunned. He would never have expected anything like that. But the more he thought about it, the more the man's words made sense. If he were condemned to death the beggar would be right, and would have shown himself to be the better man due to his capacity to forgive. And if the beggar was not executed, he would come away with both his life and a reputation for being a worthy adversary…without having yet moved a piece, the king knew he had already lost the match. -""How did you manage to beat me without even playing? whether I play with you or not, everyone will have seen my lack of dignity,"" Said the king, beaten. ""You are mistaken, your majesty. everyone is already aware of your infamy; it is not people who are unworthy, it is their deeds. for years your actions have shown how disgraceful and unjust you have become, judging the worth of others at a whim.""The king understood how dishonourable he had become, and he became remorseful for his crimes and his arrogance.

At the championship he was keen to show his skills but, when he tried using all those tricks and cheats he knew from a thousand different games, well… none of them worked. The competition judges had prevented any of the tricks from working. He felt terribly embarrassed: he was a good player, but without his cheats, he couldn't beat a single competitor. He was soon eliminated, and sat there, sad and pensive. Finally, they announced the name of the tournament champion. It was the poor boy from home. The one he had always beaten! Our boy realised that the poor boy had been much cleverer than himself. It hadn't mattered to the poor boy if he lost and got a good beating, because what he was really doing was learning from each of his defeats. And from so much learning he had been transformed into a real master. From then on, the boy who had loved winning gave up wanting to win all the time. He was quite happy to lose sometimes, because that was when he would learn how to win on the really important occasions. [SEP] Familiarity breeds1 contempt2.",4
154,"There was once a boy who hardly had any toys or money. Nevertheless, he was a very happy little boy. He said that what made him happy was doing things for others, and that doing so gave him a nice feeling inside. However, no one really believed him; they thought he was loopy. He spent all day helping others, dispensing charity to the poorest, and looking after abandoned animals. Very seldom did he ever do anything for himself. One day, he met a famous doctor who thought the boy's case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him. So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising.

155,"There was once a leopard in the jungle; and a very nocturnal leopard he was too. He could hardly sleep at night and, lying on a branch of his magnificent tree, he spent his time watching what was happening in the forest at night. This is how he came to learn that there was a thief in that forest. He would watch the thief go out every night with empty hands and return loaded up with his stolen loot. Sometimes the thief had nabbed the senior monkey's bananas, other times he had filched the lion's wig, or pinched the zebra's stripes. One night he even snuck home with the big elephant's false tusk, which the elephant had been secretly wearing for quite some time. However, as the leopard was a very quiet sort of cat, who lived at the margin of everything, he didn't want to say anything to anyone. He didn't see it as his business, and, if truth were told, he rather enjoyed discovering these little secrets. And so, thanks to the stealthy thief, quite a stir was being created in the world of the animals: the elephant felt ridiculous without his false tusk, and the zebra now looked like a white donkey, not to mention the lion who, now as bald as a lioness had lost all respect. Most of the other animals were in some similar position too. They were furious, confused or ridiculous, but the leopard lay quietly in his tree, each night enjoying the thief's escapades. However, one night the thief went on vacation, and after having waited a long while for him to appear, the leopard grew tired and decided to sleep for a while. When he woke up he found himself in a place very different from his usual tree, he was floating on the water of a small lake inside a cave, and around him he could see all those objects which, night after night, he had seen being stolen… the thief had cut down his tree and stolen his entire home along with the leopard himself! Well this was the last straw, so the leopard, taking advantage of the thief not being there, ran out and went straight to see the other animals to tell them where the thief had hidden all their things… they all praised the leopard for having discovered the thief and his hideout, and allowing them to recover their possessions. In the end, the animal who lost most from all this was the leopard, who couldn't replant his magnificent tree and had to make do with a much inferior tree located in a very boring site… and he regretted having not been concerned at the problems of the other animals, now seeing that in the long run those very problems had become his own.

He would jump to the ground from amazing heights, he would fight poisonous snakes, he would catch scorpions with his bare hands, and could cut the palm of his own hand with a knife - without even a flinch. They said the exact opposite about pontoma. No one had seen him catch even a monkey. One day, they happened upon each other in the forest, and manute was showing pontoma a coral snake he had just caught, when there began a downpour, the likes of which no one had ever seen. They both ran to shelter themselves under some thick foliage, and there they stayed until the rain had stopped. However, when they were about to leave the shelter, they heard the roar of a tiger, at a distance of only a couple of meters. The foliage was very thick and dense, and the tiger wouldn't be able to get through it to attack them. However, the tiger was almost at the entrance hole. If it happened to come in and find the two tribesmen there, they certainly wouldn't get out alive. Manute was getting restless. He wanted to get out of that tight hole, and confront the tiger in open space, where he could fully use his great hunting skills. Pontoma was gesturing at him to keep still and be quiet, but manute, tired of being stuck with a coward, leapt out of the thicket, surprising the tiger. The tiger suffered a couple of deep wounds, but soon recovered, and hurt manute with two swipes of its paw, throwing him to the ground. The tiger took the initiative, and leapt upon manute, but manute's spear, in the hands of pontoma, interrupted the tiger's attack. The tiger turned away, wounded, but the spear moved as fast as a beam of light, and with incredible precision, hurting the animal again and again, until it fell to the ground, lifeless. Manute, shocked, and bleeding freely from his injuries, witnessed all this while lying flat on his back on the ground. Never before had he seen anyone take on a tiger, and use the spear with such calmness and strength, as he had seen pontoma do just now. Neither of them said a thing. Manute's grateful expression needed no words to be understood. Nor did they need words to know about pontoma's wounded hand, or the fact that they were leaving a tiger skin there in the forest.

[SEP] You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. Make sure you control your temper the next time you are tempted to say something you will regret later.","Pogo the ogre, big giant, and the abominable one had spent hundreds of years locked up in monster prison. They had entered voluntarily, when they realised that frightening children wasn't a good way to make a living. Since then, the three of them had been sad and lonely figures. Frightening children was the only thing they knew how to do well. They lost all hope, and felt useless. They had already served their full jail sentences several times, but when they were told they were free to go, they answered by asking where they could go, and what could they do, if all they knew in life was scaring people…however, all that changed on the day they locked up nightmare. Nightmare was a tiny little monster, who devoted very little time to frightening others and spent most of the day sleeping. But when awake, he was great fun. He told hundreds of stories of how he had changed people's dreams to make them more amusing, and of how these changes almost always turned out so badly that they would have scared anyone. Pogo the ogre, and his friends, loved nightmare's stories, but they had to wait for the sleepyhead to get up so he could tell them. Now, that was by no means easy. It seemed not even an earthquake could wake the guy. Until one day, when the three monsters combined their terrific cries. Nightmare woke up with a start. He looked at them, wide-eyed, but he didn't seem frightened or angry. Rather, he seemed happy. - ""Great!"" He said, ""I've always wanted to get up early. that way you enjoy the day much better. you know what? you guys should work as alarm clocks.

162,"George the giant had lived for centuries in the cave of anger. The giants were peaceful, solitary beings up until the time when king terry the terrible accused them of ruining the harvest. King terry then ordered that the giants be hunted down. Only george survived this, and since then he had become the most ferocious creature there had ever been. He became invincible, and anyone who entered his cave came to a sticky end, no matter how brave or powerful they were. Many past kings, ashamed by the behaviour of terry the terrible, had tried to make peace with george, but it was all in vain. His anger and fury meant that he would do away with any human being he ever clapped eyes on, without listening to what they said. Even though the kings now left him alone, george's hatred for humans remained as strong as ever. For there was a fabulous treasure inside george's cave, and many adventurers and warriors came there from all corners of the world to try to take it. Even so, one day the young princess was bitten by a snake from the swamps. The only antidote was a secret potion known only to giants. So the king had no choice but to beg for george's help. He sent his best soldiers and his bravest knights, promising them that if one of them was successful, they could marry the princess. However, neither their magic shields, their most powerful weapons, nor their most gleaming armour could do anything in the face of george's fury. Finally, the king asked for help throughout the kingdom, still promising the princess's hand, and offering the protection of the best wizards. Many tried, armed in all sorts of different ways, and protected by the best magic, including even an invisibility spell. But every last one of them failed. Then, one day, a young musician turned up at george's cave, armed only with a harp. He made a plea to the wizards. ""I want to change into a beautiful flower, and have the voice of an angel"". And so there appeared, at the cave entrance, an incredibly beautiful flower, which was singing a lovely tune to the sound of a harp. George the giant was used to hearing only the ugly clanking of weapons, shields, and armour. On hearing something so different, and so wonderful, his anger started to subside. The flower kept singing, and george moved closer. He took the flower in is hand, so he would be able to hear it better. The song was the story of a young princess close to death, who could only be saved by a good-hearted giant. George was moved, and listened with great emotion. He became so calm and tranquil that the flower felt it was safe enough to stop singing. And in his normal speaking voice he told george all about the princess and how she needed george's help. He also told george that the king wanted to come to a fair and lasting peace agreement with him. George, tired of so much fighting, and seeing the truth of what the flower was telling him, left his cave and his anger behind, and went to heal the princess.

And both ducks swam quickly downriver. They both knew the way well, but quack had been preparing a trick for some time. He had realised that the current in the middle of the river was stronger, and would help him. So, even though mother duck had told them never to swim in the middle of the river, quack paddled over to it. ""I'm old enough now to swim here,"" He thought to himself. It wasn't long before he realised his mother had been right. He was going much faster than quick, and was developing a big lead. Quick was not amused. He never disobeyed his mother, and now his obedience meant he was going to lose the race! As they went on, the current got stronger. Quack triumphantly crossed the finishing line, without realising he was headed straight for a big whirlpool in the middle of the river. Before he could react, there he was spinning around in it, unable to escape. Getting him out of there was no easy matter. No duck was strong enough to swim in those waters, and poor quack kept swallowing water. The fact that his head was spinning like a top didn't help matters much either. Fortunately, a cow from a nearby farm came by and, seeing quack, waded in and rescued him, to prevent him from drinking all the water in the river. When he was on dry ground, he remained dizzy for quite some time. That provided quite a laugh for the various different animals that had been watching. That day, quick understood that he had done well to listen to his mother, even though at first it might have seemed the difficult option. As for quack… well… quack could not forget that experience, even though he wanted to. From then on, whenever he touched a drop of water, he fell to the floor and spun round three times before being able to get up again. Rainy days proved quite entertaining!

And there fiorina remained, hidden in her flower, filled with fear, believing herself to be the most horrible of fairies; never knowing that if she ever decided to come out, she would realise that she was the most beautiful and fortunate of all the fairies. [SEP] Understood that you cannot use lies for anything.","When you go to the land of the fairies and ask who is the most beautiful fairy in history, they'll all answer without hesitation that it is pionina. Everyone, that is, except pionina herself, who will shake her head and silently think about her sister fiorina. No one has yet seen her, but fiorina was clearly the most beautiful of the two fairy sisters. Both were born from the same big, perfect, dewdrop, and for years they spent their lives together inside the same flower. The problem was that they were so shy that they never wanted to go out into the world. As they didn't know any other fairies, they wondered whether they themselves were beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, fortunate or unlucky. They thought about this so much and so often that they ended up convinced that they were ugly, stupid and unlucky. So much so, that they resolved never to leave their comfortable flower. There they stayed, living their lives regretting their misfortune. How could they show themselves to the world, when they were such a pair of disasters? What would others say about them? And what if others rejected them and ridiculed them? That was, until one day when pionina summoned up enough courage to leave the flower. -""It's not my fault I'm so horrible,"" She told herself, -""I will try to be kind and cheerful, and maybe that way they will forgive me my flaws,"" She thought, now determined to venture out. Pionina tried everything to get her sister to go with her, but fiorina didn't feel capable of overcoming her shyness. Even though she was really dying to leave the flower, she decided to stay…when pionina leapt out, and began her acrobatic flight across the land, a special gleaming light enveloped the whole countryside. Seeing this light, hundreds of fairies emerged from their flowers to take it all in. They all watched in admiration as they beheld the most beautiful fairy anyone had ever seen. Before long, there was a huge commotion all around pionina, and in only a few short minutes she had become the most famous of all fairies, thanks to her beauty, her intelligence, and her good fortune. Pionina then hurried off to tell her sister how mistaken they had been for all those years. The problem was, she didn't know the way back to her flower. In that land there were hundreds of thousands of flowers, just like her own. Pionina couldn't tell which one was the one she had lived in. She searched and searched, but could never manage to find fiorina. And there fiorina remained, hidden in her flower, filled with fear, believing herself to be the most horrible of fairies; never knowing that if she ever decided to come out, she would realise that she was the most beautiful and fortunate of all the fairies.

They were of great variety and colour, and they turned that place into a kind of paradise that everyone could enjoy. There was only one thing in those gardens that the king disliked: near the centre stood the remains of what had been, centuries ago, a huge tree, but that now was withered and dry, and detracted from the colour and beauty of its surroundings. This bothered the king so much that he finally ordered it to be cut down and replaced by a beautiful series of fountains. Some time later, a wise noble was visiting the king at his palace.

Asked the king. -""Well, because now all from your garden are at my house. before I was born my father collected that old tree you had torn out from the middle of the garden, and he planted it in our garden. since then, every spring, from out of that tree come thousands and thousands of moths. with time, the moths attracted the birds, and new plants and trees grew, providing food for other animals that, in turn, provided food for others… and now, my father's old place is filled with life and colour. all thanks to the moths from the big old tree."" -""Excellent!"" Exclaimed the king, -""Now I'll be able to recover my gardens. and you, I'll make you rich. rest assured that within a week everything will be ready. use as many men as you like."" -""Your majesty, I'm afraid that cannot be,"" Said the young man, -""If you like I can try to recreate the gardens, but you will not live to see it. it will take many years for the natural balance to reestablish itself. with great good fortune perhaps I, when I'm old, will see it completed. things like these do not depend on how many men work on them.""The face of the old king was sad and pensive, understanding how delicate was the balance of nature, and how careless it had been to break it so happily. But he so loved those gardens and those creatures that he decided to build a huge palace next to the young man's land. And with thousands of men working on the construction, he managed to see the palace finished in much less time than would have been necessary to reestablish the balance of nature of that garden in any other place.

170,"Once upon a time a boy was walking through a little forest when he found a big blackboard hanging on an old tree trunk. It came complete with a box of chalk pieces, and bright sparks were flying from the tips of every piece of chalk. The boy took a piece of chalk and started to draw on the board: first a tree, then a rabbit, then a flower…magically, whenever he finished a figure it came to life and jumped out of the board. Before long, the place had become a wonderfully green and fertile forest, full of animals happily playing. Excited, the boy also drew his parents and brothers and sisters enjoying a picnic, with their sandwiches and cold meats. He also drew the paper plates and the empty tins of sardines left on the ground, which always happened on their picnics. But when these bits of litter came to life something awful happened: around every paper plate and every empty tin, the forest turned grey, and this greyness started quickly spreading everywhere: to the grass, to the flowers, to the animals… the boy realised the litter was to blame for all the greyness, so he ran through the forest with the blackboard rubber in his hand to rub them out wherever they had landed. He was lucky. He was quick, and didn't leave a single piece of litter. The forest and its animals managed to recover, and they played together for the rest of the day. The boy never again saw that blackboard, but now, every time he goes to the countryside with his family, he remembers that adventure and is the first to pick up any litter. And he is sure to remind the others that anything left lying in the woods can do more damage to the animals than they ever would have suspected.

He got such a fright that he couldn't even move his lips. The two boys were speechless, and although waterworks was just about to cry, during those moments of silence, he missed charlie's happy words so much that he finally said, ""Wow, charlie, that's a nice clown disguise you just put on. and so quickly too!""And, on saying those words, waterworks felt so good, that he finally understood why charlie was always so happy and cheerful. He realised that he was now so used to his friend's enthusiasm that he couldn't help but see the good and the funny side of everything. [SEP] Enemies promises were made to be broken4.","Cheerful charlie was a very special boy. When he was still tiny, and in his mother's tummy, she had had an accident, which meant that charlie couldn't walk. But that had never been a problem for him; he had always been happy to be able to grow and become an older boy. They had started calling him cheerful charlie because his joyful and enthusiastic nature was so contagious. He really brightened everything up for those around him. There wasn't a builder, a postman, or a taxi driver who wasn't pleased to see charlie. ""Cheer up, mr. postman, that way you'll deliver more letters today than any other!"" He would say, or ""That was great, mr. taxi driver, you park that thing better than anyone. you should enter a competition!"" He also had great ideas and solutions for everything; and he shared them so generously that, just about every day in that town, someone did a great job of something, or invented something new, thanks to charlie's ideas. One day, though, he came up against a really tough nut to crack. A young boy came to town on his holidays. He was known as waterworks, and he was a real crybaby. No matter what charlie said to him, waterworks would always find some reason to be sad: ""I don't have many sweets… my parents didn't buy me that toy… I can't watch television… I have to go to school, and I don't like it…"" Everything seemed so bad to him.

174,"Once upon a time there was a spring who lived happily and safely inside a pen. Although he heard many noises coming from outside, he lived believing that outside his world inside the pen, there was nothing good. Even just to think about leaving his pen made him so scared that he was quite content to spend his life compacting and stretching himself again and again inside that tiny space. However, one day, the ink ran out, and when the pen's owner was busy changing it, there was an accident. The spring was flung through the air and landed in the toilet drain, well out of sight. Terrified, and cursing his bad luck, the spring was flushed through pipe after pipe, each time thinking it might be his end. During the journey, he did not dare open his eyes out of pure fear. Nor did he every stop crying. Swept away by the water, he travelled on and on and on, until he ended up in a river. When the river current lost its force, and the spring could see that things had calmed down a bit, he stopped crying and listened all around him. Hearing birdsong and wind in the trees, he felt encouraged to finally open his eyes. What the spring saw was the pure, crystal waters of the river, the rich green rocks of the riverbed, and all kinds of fish of many colours, whose skin seemed to dance under the sunlight. Now he understood that the world was much greater than the space inside the pen, and that there had always been many things outside, waiting to be enjoyed. After spending a while playing with the fish, he went over to the riverbank, and then moved on to a field of flowers. There he heard weeping. He followed the sound, which took him to a lovely flower that had been flattened by a rabbit, and could no longer stand up straight.

He was still pretty much a boy, but was so brave and intelligent that, without having to fight anyone at all, he had defeated all his enemies. One day, while riding through the mountains, he came across a small cave. On entering it he found it was enormous, and that inside was an impressive castle, so big that he thought the mountain couldn't be real, and that it must have been a facade put there to hide the castle. On nearing the castle, edward heard the sound of voices. Without hesitating, he climbed over the castle walls, and followed the voices. ""Anybody here?"" He asked. ""Help! help us!"" Came the response from inside, ""We've been locked in here for years, serving the castle dragon."" ""Dragon?"" Thought edward, just before an enormous flying flame almost burnt him alive. Edward spun silently around, and addressing the terrible dragon face to face, said: ""It's all right, dragon. I forgive you for what you just did. you probably didn't know it was me.""The dragon was very surprised at words like these. He never expected anyone to stand up to him, and certainly not in such a brazen manner. ""Prepare to fight, dwarf! I don't give a fig who you are!"" Roared the dragon. ""Wait a moment. well, it's clear that you don't know who I am. I am the guardian of the great crystal sword!"" Continued edward, who - before fighting - was capable of making all sorts of things up. ""You well know that the sword has killed dozens of ogres and dragons, and that if I unsheathe it, it will fly straight into your neck and kill you.""The dragon had never heard of such a sword, but this frightened him. He certainly didn't like the sound of something cutting his throat. Edward carried on talking. ""In any case, I want to give you a chance to fight me. let's travel to the other side of the world. over there there's a snow-covered mountain, and at the summit there's a great tower. at the top of the tower there's a golden cage where a wizard made this sword. there the sword loses all its power. I'll be there, but will only wait for you for five days.""On saying that, edward raised a cloud of dust and disappeared. The dragon thought edward had performed some kind of magic, but he had only hidden in some bushes. Wanting to fight with that impudent knight, the dragon quickly flew out of the cave, towards the other side of the world, in a journey which lasted more than a month. When edward was sure the dragon was far away, he came out of his hiding place, entered the castle, and set free all the prisoners inside. Some had been missing for many years, and when they returned home everyone praised edward's great intelligence. And what about the dragon? Well, can you believe that on the other side of the world there was really a snowy mountain with a big tower on top, and a gold cage on top of that?

177,"""Charlieeeeeeee, do your homework now!"" Wow, his mother was really bellowing at him. Charlie thought, ""Well, she doesn't have to do it. it's so boring"", and he spent hours with his books, hoping that time would pass and it would soon be time for supper. As usual, he was lying on his bed, busy staring at the ceiling, daydreaming. Suddenly some little elves, no more than a centimetre tall, appeared by the window. ""Good evening, young man, will you please give us your homework so we can play with it?"", asked one of the elves, politely. Charlie laughed. ""How are you lot going to play with homework? it's the most boring stuff there is! ha, ha, ha… go on, take it. you can play with it as long as you like"". Charlie watched his guests, and was so surprised to see what they did. In less than a minute, they had formed teams and were busy playing with the pen, the eraser, the book, and the pad of paper. Very strange stuff they were getting up to. Like with the sums, instead of moving the pen across the paper, they would hold the pen still and move the paper instead. Or like how they had races to see who could do the sums fastest. And then they all dressed up as either father christmas, a halloween pumpkin, or a bag of cheese. And whenever the clock was stopped, the elf who was in the lead got to draw himself in the notepad. So the pad ended up full of santas and pumpkins. They were also really funny while learning to read. They used well-known songs, and had to learn the words to them. When they had done that they put on a big concert to sing those songs. Charlie really enjoyed watching those little students, he even joined in with the singing. And time passed so quickly, that suddenly his mother was calling him for supper.

178,"The little blue hummingbird felt sad and tired. He had become lost while traveling with his family, who were looking for a warmer place to spend the winter. When night came, after much time spent looking for them, but with no luck, he took refuge in a small cave he found in the mountainside. Inside the cave there were only a few dry twigs and leaves that had been blown their by the wind. Although feeding himself wasn't a worry, seeing as he had always been so good at it, not knowing whether he would see his loved ones again deeply saddened him. -""Don't stray far from us when we're migrating,"" His parents had always repeated to him. But he would get so excited at all the little things he would discover during their journeys, and there he would be, open-mouthed, contemplating these wonders, flapping his wings over every new treasure, while the others just carried on with the journey, not noticing his absence. That day, while flying, he had seen a flash of light, a reflection coming out of the trees, and without realising it, he swooped low and approached to see what was the source of the beautiful light. And he discovered an enormous, picturesque lake of crystalline waters; a sight that left him completely surprised. -""Wow!!"" He exclaimed, seeing himself reflected in the water, -""How wonderful!!""He'd never seen anything like it. The sun was beginning to fire its rays onto the water, and these became brilliant golden reflections that almost blinded you. It was a spectacular sight. There he played, flying over the water, playing with his own reflection; using the calm waters as a mirror, viewing the white clouds sliding past overhead. Time passed without him realising, and when he gained altitude and called for his family so he could show them what he'd found, his call went unanswered. His parents and brothers and sisters had continued on with the journey, and they couldn't hear him. Suddenly an enormous fear arose in him. All that beauty disappeared from his eyes, and he could only hear strange noises that increased his fear and his feeling of uneasiness. Cries of strange birds echoed around the forest, and everything that had hitherto seemed beautiful turned into something gloomy and ghostly. The sun now seemed to cast only shade, and he was afraid of being left alone in the forest. He flew out of the trees, in search of his family, but the night came and he was still alone. So then he sought out a place to shelter and pass the night. With the little leaves he found in the cave he made a small nest. It was a bit noisy since the leaves were so dry, but at least it gave him some warmth that night. The following day, when he woke, he didn't remember that he'd become lost, but soon after getting up it all came to mind, and he began worrying. -""Oh, my god! what will I do here alone? where is my family?"" And he soon found out how much he missed them. His parents had always repeated to him that, if someday he should get lost, what he should do is not go far from the last place they had all been together, put himself in a place that was high enough so he could be seen when they returned, and that he should never allow fear to stop him seeing reality. -""It's true!!"" He said, remembering this, -""My parents told me what I would have to do if I get lost, so I have nothing to be afraid of. my family is looking for me right now, and soon we'll be together.""And so he left his little cave, thanking it for having given him shelter that night. Once again everything outside was beautiful, and the confidence that he would find his family made him fly happily in what was an unknown place for him. Before long he once more found the beautiful lake, and there he found the tallest tree, where he perched himself. While he was waiting he began humming, and gradually the little birds who lived there joined in with him. He told them he was lost, and the birds decided to sing really loudly so that anyone passing would hear them. Soon their song could be heard from very far off, and this helped his family to quickly find him. After that day, our little hummingbird was a bit wiser. Now he knew that he should always let his family know when was going to fly off from them during their travels. He also knew that during the course of his life he would meet others who would offer him their help. And, most important of all, he learned that when fear got the better of him the most beautiful things could come to appear the most terrifying.

While he was waiting he began humming, and gradually the little birds who lived there joined in with him. He told them he was lost, and the birds decided to sing really loudly so that anyone passing would hear them. Soon their song could be heard from very far off, and this helped his family to quickly find him. After that day, our little hummingbird was a bit wiser. Now he knew that he should always let his family know when was going to fly off from them during their travels. He also knew that during the course of his life he would meet others who would offer him their help. And, most important of all, he learned that when fear got the better of him the most beautiful things could come to appear the most terrifying. [SEP] Harm hatch, harm catch.","The little blue hummingbird felt sad and tired. He had become lost while traveling with his family, who were looking for a warmer place to spend the winter. When night came, after much time spent looking for them, but with no luck, he took refuge in a small cave he found in the mountainside. Inside the cave there were only a few dry twigs and leaves that had been blown their by the wind. Although feeding himself wasn't a worry, seeing as he had always been so good at it, not knowing whether he would see his loved ones again deeply saddened him. -""Don't stray far from us when we're migrating,"" His parents had always repeated to him. But he would get so excited at all the little things he would discover during their journeys, and there he would be, open-mouthed, contemplating these wonders, flapping his wings over every new treasure, while the others just carried on with the journey, not noticing his absence. That day, while flying, he had seen a flash of light, a reflection coming out of the trees, and without realising it, he swooped low and approached to see what was the source of the beautiful light. And he discovered an enormous, picturesque lake of crystalline waters; a sight that left him completely surprised. -""Wow!!"" He exclaimed, seeing himself reflected in the water, -""How wonderful!!""He'd never seen anything like it. The sun was beginning to fire its rays onto the water, and these became brilliant golden reflections that almost blinded you. It was a spectacular sight. There he played, flying over the water, playing with his own reflection; using the calm waters as a mirror, viewing the white clouds sliding past overhead. Time passed without him realising, and when he gained altitude and called for his family so he could show them what he'd found, his call went unanswered. His parents and brothers and sisters had continued on with the journey, and they couldn't hear him. Suddenly an enormous fear arose in him. All that beauty disappeared from his eyes, and he could only hear strange noises that increased his fear and his feeling of uneasiness. Cries of strange birds echoed around the forest, and everything that had hitherto seemed beautiful turned into something gloomy and ghostly. The sun now seemed to cast only shade, and he was afraid of being left alone in the forest. He flew out of the trees, in search of his family, but the night came and he was still alone. So then he sought out a place to shelter and pass the night. With the little leaves he found in the cave he made a small nest. It was a bit noisy since the leaves were so dry, but at least it gave him some warmth that night. The following day, when he woke, he didn't remember that he'd become lost, but soon after getting up it all came to mind, and he began worrying. -""Oh, my god! what will I do here alone? where is my family?"" And he soon found out how much he missed them. His parents had always repeated to him that, if someday he should get lost, what he should do is not go far from the last place they had all been together, put himself in a place that was high enough so he could be seen when they returned, and that he should never allow fear to stop him seeing reality. -""It's true!!"" He said, remembering this, -""My parents told me what I would have to do if I get lost, so I have nothing to be afraid of. my family is looking for me right now, and soon we'll be together.""And so he left his little cave, thanking it for having given him shelter that night.

180,"There once was a daddy who was in such a hurry to finish the stories that he told his children every night that he began to leave out some of the words. Taking out words here and there, he was able to finish the stories a little quicker. However, this still didn't seem enough, so he kept shortening them more and more until, one day, he cut out the most important words of a tale: ""The end"". That night he went to bed peacefully but he woke up feeling rather strange. He got up and when he looked in the mirror he realised that he was wearing a big pirate hat and a black eye-patch and had an enormous red beard with white spots! There was no doubt in his mind: he had been transformed into flamenco beard, the notorious pirate captain from his tales. Worried, he ran to his children's bedrooms. As he opened the door, a great wall of water came crashing down on him and he soon found himself swimming in the middle of the sea. He wasn't alone, however. He was being chased by hungry sharks which had not eaten for weeks. Flamenco beard prepared himself to fight, grabbing the butter knife that he always kept hidden under his hat. Just as he was about to lunge at the first shark, he felt himself being lifted into the air and then dropped onto the deck of a giant pirate ship. ""That was close, captain"" - said a pirate sailor who was the spitting image of his eldest son. ""The captain could've dealt with those clumsy sharks!"" Shouted a couple of cabin boys who were so similar flamenco beard could have sworn they were his twins. There was no time to lose. The captain was told that the queen had been kidnapped and there would be a great reward for whoever rescued her safe and sound. Without a second thought, they set sail to the island of the last cannibal, the favourite spot for all baddies wishing to hide kidnapped queens. They were at full sail when a big, dark storm started to form and, as fate would have it, a bolt of lightning struck the mast of the ship, triggering a massive fire. They were so busy putting out the fire that they didn't realise that an enormous wave had hurled the ship onto the reefs around the island with so much force that the captain and his sailors were sent flying into the air. When the captain woke up, he found himself tied to a big tree trunk. His crew of pirates was tied up next to him. They were in the heart of the island's volcano, the place chosen by the cannibals for their sacrifices and rituals. However, they were not the ones who were going to be eaten. Everything had been put in place to sacrifice a beautiful woman with a crown, who had to be the queen. The cannibals started their chants. How annoying, they always did everything while singing. Then the captain had an idea. With a loud voice, he began to sing pirate songs and all the crew joined in singing at the top of their voices. The cannibals tried to sing louder and, even though there were more of them, they couldn't sing louder than the captain and his men. Without their chants, they couldn't begin the feast so, red in the face with anger, they decided to switch the captain for the queen. Now it was the captain who was hanging above a big pot, about to be cooked. He could feel the burning of the pepper and smell the sauce, and he became so hot that he no longer had the strength to sing. His men were silenced also by the big dollops of chocolate ice cream they were eating with relish. How did those savages know that chocolate ice cream was his crew's weakness? Just then he saw the queen smile, a crooked smile that only withered flower possessed. Clearly, it had all been a trap, set by the fearsome woman pirate captain - once his greatest companion but was now his biggest rival - to capture flamenco beard and his men. Surrounded by cannibals and grimacing at the pain of the first bite, the captain accepted defeat.

That night he went to bed peacefully but he woke up feeling rather strange. He got up and when he looked in the mirror he realised that he was wearing a big pirate hat and a black eye-patch and had an enormous red beard with white spots! There was no doubt in his mind: he had been transformed into flamenco beard, the notorious pirate captain from his tales. Worried, he ran to his children's bedrooms. As he opened the door, a great wall of water came crashing down on him and he soon found himself swimming in the middle of the sea. He wasn't alone, however. He was being chased by hungry sharks which had not eaten for weeks. Flamenco beard prepared himself to fight, grabbing the butter knife that he always kept hidden under his hat. Just as he was about to lunge at the first shark, he felt himself being lifted into the air and then dropped onto the deck of a giant pirate ship. ""That was close, captain"" - said a pirate sailor who was the spitting image of his eldest son. ""The captain could've dealt with those clumsy sharks!"" Shouted a couple of cabin boys who were so similar flamenco beard could have sworn they were his twins. There was no time to lose. The captain was told that the queen had been kidnapped and there would be a great reward for whoever rescued her safe and sound. Without a second thought, they set sail to the island of the last cannibal, the favourite spot for all baddies wishing to hide kidnapped queens. They were at full sail when a big, dark storm started to form and, as fate would have it, a bolt of lightning struck the mast of the ship, triggering a massive fire. They were so busy putting out the fire that they didn't realise that an enormous wave had hurled the ship onto the reefs around the island with so much force that the captain and his sailors were sent flying into the air. When the captain woke up, he found himself tied to a big tree trunk. His crew of pirates was tied up next to him. They were in the heart of the island's volcano, the place chosen by the cannibals for their sacrifices and rituals. However, they were not the ones who were going to be eaten. Everything had been put in place to sacrifice a beautiful woman with a crown, who had to be the queen. The cannibals started their chants. How annoying, they always did everything while singing. Then the captain had an idea. With a loud voice, he began to sing pirate songs and all the crew joined in singing at the top of their voices. The cannibals tried to sing louder and, even though there were more of them, they couldn't sing louder than the captain and his men. Without their chants, they couldn't begin the feast so, red in the face with anger, they decided to switch the captain for the queen. Now it was the captain who was hanging above a big pot, about to be cooked. He could feel the burning of the pepper and smell the sauce, and he became so hot that he no longer had the strength to sing. His men were silenced also by the big dollops of chocolate ice cream they were eating with relish. How did those savages know that chocolate ice cream was his crew's weakness? Just then he saw the queen smile, a crooked smile that only withered flower possessed. Clearly, it had all been a trap, set by the fearsome woman pirate captain - once his greatest companion but was now his biggest rival - to capture flamenco beard and his men. Surrounded by cannibals and grimacing at the pain of the first bite, the captain accepted defeat. ""You win, withered flower. this is the end.""On saying that last word, everything disappeared and the daddy found himself in bed, still scared and sweaty. Lying next to him, wearing the same crooked smile as withered flower, his wife gave him a kiss and said: ""Next time you shorten the stories you tell the children, you'll have me to deal with in the cave of madness.""The daddy lay deep in reflection throughout the night. It had been great fun to be part of the stories but he was also so terrified that he vowed never to cut even a single word from his children's stories again. [SEP] Mother's love has no equals.",3
181,"Sarah and mark were a pair of champion gossips. They were always spying, and poking their noses into anything and everything. And how they loved to broadcast what they had discovered - which was a lot, and very little of it good. People had often explained to them the importance of respecting others' privacy, but they would just reply, ""If they had nothing to hide then they wouldn't mind. we have nothing to hide, so we couldn't care less.""Then, one day, a poor, bad-tempered wizard with very few powers, crossed their path.

182,"The magi-virus was the first ever magical virus. It was an enchantment that passed from person to person: all you needed was two men, women, children, or old folk to touch each other, and the virus would spread from one to another. The effects of this spell varied according to the disease, but they usually took the form of small magical misfortunes, such as becoming suddenly bald, sneezing out ice cubes, crying out of your feet, or having such sticky hands that it was impossible to let go of anything you'd picked up. It being the case that not everyone touches others with the same frequency, it so happened that some people passed on the magic illness very easily, but others - those with less contact with people - became really seriously ill, particularly when they'd spent more than three days with the virus. Of course, no-one thought these small misfortunes were caused by a virus, and the blame was usually pinned on some mischievous elf or passing witch. Only one doctor from that area - dr. Ivor malady - , began suspecting something, after having contracted the illness over twenty times himself, and almost always after doing his rounds. He began experimenting on his patients and on himself, and within a few days he was certain about how the disease was transmitted. The good doctor called all the townsfolk to a meeting and told them that their illness would last for as long as it took them to touch someone else. And so it was that the town became the world chasing capital. Residents spent much of their time chasing others around the streets, to touch their chosen victim, in order to get rid of the virus. Even the oldest folk joined in the fun, and the people's health improved so much with all the running about that dr. Malady was presented with many prizes and awards. The funniest thing is that the magi-virus moved towns without anyone realising it. It was taken away by a man who came to visit, and bumped into a ""Carrier"" Who was sprinting after some children. On returning to his home town, things were a bit different, and instead of chase, that town became world hugging capital. Everyone who passed that way was given a great big bear hug, along with the magic illness. So it didn't take long for the virus to move on to another town, and in this third town the people ended up spending all hours of the day kissing each other. And so it was, one after another, the magi-virus went around the world, changing people's behaviour wherever it went, making every place more fun and more friendly, leaving everyone feeling closer.

As a result, the boy managed to cheer up everyone around him. People saw him and wanted to be like him, so they behaved cheerfully, and, in turn, cheered up others. The boy travelled the whole land, bringing smiles to people's faces, and happiness to their hearts. He ended up transforming the entire country from one of sadness and depression to one which could even be called happyland.

184,"There was once a boy whose greatest dream was to have a rocket, and launch it to the moon. Unfortunately, he had little money and couldn't afford one. One day, at the side of a path, he found a box for one of his favourite kinds of rocket. Opening it, he found there was only one rocket inside, made of dodgy paper, the consequence of a factory malfunction. The boy was very disappointed, but at least he now finally had a rocket of sorts. He started preparing his plans for the launch. For many days he collected paper of all shapes, sizes and colours; and with all his soul he set about drawing, painting, cutting, sticking, and colouring all the stars and planets that would turn his rocket into an outer space in paper form. It wasn't an easy job, but the final result was so magnificent that his bedroom wall looked like an open window onto the galaxy. From then on, the boy enjoyed playing with his paper rocket every day. One day, a friend came to visit, and in the boy's bedroom he saw that spectacular sight. The friend offered to swap it with the boy, for a real rocket he had at home. The boy went almost mad with joy, and delightedly accepted the swap. Since then, each day, playing with his new rocket, the boy would miss more and more his old paper rocket, with its planets, stars and all the rest. Really, he had much preferred playing with that one. He realised that it was much more fun playing with toys he had made himself, with great effort and enthusiasm.

In reality, then, he had no idea what things cost, and wouldn't bother to take care of what he had. Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was so used to all his toys and various stuff, that he began to want something different. One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to charlie, as something unusual. Charlie was very excited at having a horse. He learned to ride, and was constantly on his horse, going here and there. However, he treated the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking neglected and sick. For the first time in his life charlie became truly worried. He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to swap it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had managed this, charlie secretly followed them, watching everything they did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never hit the horse. This was the opposite of what charlie had done to his horse, right from day one. Then they came to the stable, and as soon as they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. He'd never done any of that for his horse. He saw that the girl spent a lot of time giving care and attention to her horse, and that she did it all on her own. This had never entered into charlie's mind; he had always been too preoccupied with playing and having fun to look after the horse. Charlie wanted to change and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he went over to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily accepted. With her he learned how to put care and effort into things, and that if you did so you enjoyed them much more. He learned that you could be much happier with only a few special things that you truly cared for and looked after, than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then thrown aside. But not everything was easy. Charlie also learned that the care put into these things was sometimes difficult, and it needed dedication of time and effort to do it well. So much so, that it even crossed his mind to go back to his old way of treating his horse.

Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was so used to all his toys and various stuff, that he began to want something different. One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to charlie, as something unusual. Charlie was very excited at having a horse. He learned to ride, and was constantly on his horse, going here and there. However, he treated the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking neglected and sick. For the first time in his life charlie became truly worried. He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to swap it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had managed this, charlie secretly followed them, watching everything they did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never hit the horse. This was the opposite of what charlie had done to his horse, right from day one. Then they came to the stable, and as soon as they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. He'd never done any of that for his horse. He saw that the girl spent a lot of time giving care and attention to her horse, and that she did it all on her own. This had never entered into charlie's mind; he had always been too preoccupied with playing and having fun to look after the horse. Charlie wanted to change and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he went over to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily accepted. With her he learned how to put care and effort into things, and that if you did so you enjoyed them much more. He learned that you could be much happier with only a few special things that you truly cared for and looked after, than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then thrown aside. But not everything was easy. Charlie also learned that the care put into these things was sometimes difficult, and it needed dedication of time and effort to do it well. So much so, that it even crossed his mind to go back to his old way of treating his horse. However, when the horse finally recovered all its strength and splendour, that first ride, alongside the girl, made him so happy that a doubling of his effort would have been worthwhile. As a result, charlie gave up constantly asking for new toys. Grateful to his friend, he gave her many of his own toys, and more to the children of the village. He only kept those few toys he really liked. And, just as he had learned with the horse, he set himself to repairing and caring for those toys, so he could really enjoy playing with them.

Just then an innocent boy entered that room and seeing extinguished candles, he said, ""Why didn't you candles burn till the end? how can you leave like this?""At this, fourth candle said to boy, ""Dear child, don't be sad, I am hope and while I am burning you can light rest of candles again.""Hearing this child eyes sparkled and he took that candle of hope and relight candles of peace, faith and love.

209,"Once upon a time, there was merchant who used to roam from city to city for work with his three camels. One night, when merchant was tired from all day work and wanted to rest, he thought that he might stay in a inn and tie his camels outside that inn. He looked around and found an inn to stay for night. He started tying his camels outside inn. After tying two of his camels, he found that rope ended and there was no rope left to tie third camel for night. He tried to make camel sit with other two tied camels but camel didn't sit, this made merchant upset. Just at that time, a sage was passing by. When sage looked at merchant upset, he asked, ""What happened? you look upset. tell me what's wrong, maybe I can help you.""Merchant replied, ""Baba, I am tired of walking all day. now I want to rest inside the inn but I am short of rope to tie this third camel. I can't leave it outside for night without tying.""When sage heard his problem, he started laughing loudly and said, ""Tie this third camel in same way as you have tied other two camels.""Merchant was surprised and said, ""But I just told you that I don't have any rope left.""Sage said, ""Yes, I know but when I said that tie it with a rope, I mean you should tie this third camel with rope of imagination.""Merchant did same. He pretended to put a noose rope around camel's neck and tied other end to tree. As soon as he did this, third camel sat down very comfortably. Merchant went inside inn and slept comfortably.

Man left again and thanked his friend for his gift and help. But then again, after ten days, man was back with horse. Friend said, ""Welcome again my friend. it's look like you didn't get that far. what happened this time?""Man replied, ""Same thing as last time.

After month ended, man left once again. Friend and his wife bid farewell to him. After he left, wife asked, ""You were overly kind to this fellow. first you gave him a horse and then he came back twice. we hosted him and gave him everything and even helped him train horse for whole month. did we really have to do all that for him? wasn't giving him horse was enough?""He replied to his wife, ""Everyone likes to get gifts. it's very good to get a gift from someone but what if someone doesn't know how to use it? what is use of the gift? person may need some help and maybe even some training to make gift useful. who do you think should give that training?""

212,"Tess, eight year old girl, who heard her mom and dad talking about her little brother, andy. All she could understand was that her brother was very sick and her parents were completely out of money. Her parents were talking about how costly surgery was and it was looking like there was no one to loan them money. Just then she heard, dad said to her tearful mother with whispered desperation, ""Only a miracle can save him now.""Listening to this tess went to her bedroom and bought out her piggy bank from its hiding place in closet. She broke it and collected all that money. She carefully counted it. She took a small purse, placed coins in it and slipped out of back door and made her way six blocks to drug store. She waited patiently for pharmacist to give her some attention but he was too busy at this moment. She made some noise with her feet to grab attention but nothing. Then she cleared her throat with most disgusting sound she could muster but still no good. Finally she took a quarter from her pocket and banged it on glass counter and that did it. She got pharmacist attention. Pharmacist asked in annoyed tone of voice, ""And what do you want?""Without waiting for reply to his question, he said, ""I am busy. I am talking to my brother whom I haven't seen in ages.""Tess answered back, ""Well, I want to talk to you about my brother. he is really really sick, and I want to buy a miracle.""""I beg your pardon?"", said pharmacist. Tess said, ""His name is andy and he has something bad growing inside his head and my dad says only a miracle can save him now. so how much does a miracle cost?""""We don't sell miracles here, little girl.

Tess replied, ""I have money to pay for it. if it isn't enough, I will get the rest. just tell me how much it costs.""Pharmacist brother who was standing there, seeing all this, he stooped down and asked little girl, ""What kind of miracle does your brother need?""""I don't know."", tess replied with tears in her eyes, ""I don't know. I just know that he is really sick and my mommy says that he needs an operation but my dad can't pay for it, so I want to use my money.""""How much do you have?"", he asked. Tess answered, ""One dollar and eleven cents, it's all I have but I can get some more if I need to.""He smiled and said, ""Well, what a coincidence. a dollar and eleven cents is exact price of a miracle for little brother.""Then he took her money in one hand and with other hand he grasped her mitten and said, ""Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents. let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need.""That man, pharmacist brother was dr. Carlton armstrong, a surgeon, specializing in neurosurgery.

Tess mom and dad were happily talking about chain of events that took place.

Man said, ""Mam, it's chilly outside, why don't you wait in car where it's warm while I change it.""Saying this, man crawled under car and started to change tire. Soon tire was changed. As he was finishing up, old woman rolled down her car window and began to talk to him. She told him about herself and told him that she was from far away place and was passing by that place and thanked him enough for coming to her aid.

Lady noticed that waitress was nearly eight months pregnant but still was working hard there with smile on her face. Old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so caring and giving to a stranger and then she remembered bryan. After lady finished her meal, she paid with hundred dollar bill. Waitress went inside to get change but before she came back, old lady was gone. While waitress wondered where lady could be, she noticed that something was written on napkin.

They grieved at its thoughtlessness and feared lest it should be deceived. They refused to go with lion. Lion didn't said anything and left. He started to come to them daily.

Lion called him and said, ""See, color of your body and mine are reddish brown and black doesn't go with our color. it will be very good if I eat black cow. so that in forest we all will be of same color.""Brown cow agreed and left black cow alone.

I am going to eat you.""Brown cow with great fear and horror said, ""Why? I am your friend. I did whatever you said then why do you want to eat me?""Lion roared and said, ""Your friend? how is it possible that a lion makes friendship with a cow?""No matter how much brown cow begged and entreated, lion didn't listen and attacked cow. Just then brown cow said, ""Please al teast allow me to cry three times before you eat me.""Lion allowed. Brown cow cried out, ""I was eaten day, white cow was eaten.

243,"Once bodhidharma decided to visit china. His fame had reached before him. Chinese emperor himself came to receive bodhidharma. Emperor had come from far away, from his capital in center to border of china, to receive bodhidharma. Bodhidharma when reached, he was carrying one shoe on his head and one was on his foot, this shocked emperor. Emperor was very sophisticated man, he had a court of very cultured people. Emperor couldn't say anything about it but still he avoided seeing shoe sitting on bodhidharma head. Emperor was a very religious person. He was the one under whose supervision thousands of buddha's status were built in china. Hundreds of scholars were bought to china for translation of buddhist script. Monks used to praise him saying, ""You have accumulated too much virtue. you are going to be immensely rewarded in other worlds.""So, meeting bodhidharma emperor first question was, ""I have done all these things. what is going to be my reward?""Bodhidharma replied in loud voice, ""You idiot..! you will fall directly into hell. you are asking for reward? the very idea of reward is of greed. they very idea of achieving something for things you have done, is not a reflection of your wisdom.""Emperor was shocked, everyone around was shocked. Emperor didn't like it and thought that may be he is not right man to bring into country. Still ignoring the insulting language of bodhidharma, he said, ""Your holiness..""And before he could complete his sentence, bodhidharma interrupted and said, ""There is nothing holy, nothing unholy. all is empty, just pure nothingness. these are just divisions of mind, sacred and profane, holy and unholy, saint and sinner. these do no exist as you enter into deeper meditation.so don't call me - your holiness. I have left behind that kind of childish language. be straightforward.""Emperor said, ""My mind continuously remains clustered with thoughts. I have been reading buddhist scripture and they all say that - unless you are thoughtless and yet perfectly aware, you will not find truth.""This time bodhidharma replied in calm voice, ""If that is problem, come early in morning. I am not entering china, I am going to live outside in small temple. you can come early in morning at three o'clock but come alone - no courtier, no guards nothing.just come alone and I will put all your thoughts aside from your mind.

255,"Once upon a time, lived an old crane near a small pond which was full of small fishes. Crane was in habit of picking fishes with his beak and eat them. With age it was becoming difficult for him to catch fishes. Due to drought, water level in pond became lower and still it wasn't easy for crane to catch and eat fish. However, no matter how many he ate, he was never completely satisfied and thought that may be if he ate all the fishes in pond then he will feel satisfied and happy.

I will be like a paradise for you.""Fish became a little suspicious, ""How can we believe you? you have been filling your stomach eating fish. why would you help us?""Crane then raised his head and made himself look as dignified as he could and said, ""Please don't think such thing. I am changed. if you don't believe me, send one fish with me and I will show him another pond and bring back too all of you. then you will know I can be trusted.""Fish discussed and decided that they will send a little trouble maker fish to check if crane is changed or not.

Crane flew down to shore and said, ""Now, please release me. please trust me I won't eat you.""Crab realized that crane could not be trusted and knew if he let of that crane, then one day he would be eaten for sure.

273,"Once there was huge temple built in center of lake. There lived great master and 20 of his disciples who would learn buddhism teaching's.

286,"Once in a far away village, lived a young boy who used to live with his step-family. There was scarcity of water in the village so people had to go stream of water at end of village to fetch water. Young boy used to wake up early in morning to get water from the stream for himself and his family. Sadly for him it was difficult task as the way was long and he alone had to walk there in morning and evening. While he was given such difficult task his siblings were given lenient task or none yet young boy had no hard feelings for his step-family members. Once boy was coming back home from stream with pot of water. On his way back he saw an old man resting under a tree. Seeing boy holding water pots, old man begged him for water to quench his thirst. Boy gave him water from the pot. Later on his way he met a lady who asked for water, boy gave water to her too and walked to home. Boy's water pot got half empty because of it his step-mother got angry with him for bringing only half filled pot's of water that wouldn't be enough for family. This would now happened almost everyday that people on way would ask him for water and he gave them despite knowing that his step-mother would get angry with him and even torture him for bringing half filled pot of water.

I request you to grace us by accompanying us to my country. I shall offer you with anything and everything you might require but pray. come with us.""Saint smiled and said, ""I am everywhere. I am omnipresent.""Alexander was not able to understand what saint meant and repeated his request to saint and offered temptations to him. Saint again refused to come with him by saying, ""I don't stand in need for anything..""Alexander got annoyed and felt insulted as nobody had ever refused to him. So in anger he drew his sword to kill him. Seeing this saint burst into laughter and said, ""Children sit on stand, play with it, construct small houses and then demolish them themselves. the sand does not lose anything in the process. it remains the same as before. similar was the case with the saint.for me body is like a house of sand which is built according to the innate tendencies of man. I am sand, I was never a house. if anyone wants to demolish it, is only demolishing his own house. sand remains the same.""On this retort from the saint, the sword fell down automatically from the hands of alexander the great and he apologized for his arrogance.

King called his three son and said, ""I will give you each 100 bucks and an empty room. after week I will check each room, one whose room will be filled most, will become my successor.""All of them agreed. Eldest son thought, ""At such time of inflation, how can someone fill a whole room with something with such less amount. he was not able to think of anything. so he decided that he will gamble that money and make more money so that he can have enough money to fill that room with things.""Middle son thought, ""He can't buy anything new with such less amount that can fill whole room. so he just collected all the garbage and fill that room with it. he was happy that he had filled that room as per condition of his father.""King's youngest son went to market and bought candles and scent. After one week king went to each son. First he went to eldest son and saw that he was sitting outside that room. King asked him, ""Why are you sitting outside room like this?""Eldest son told him that, ""I went to play gamble and lost that amount. now I have no money to buy anything so now I have nothing to fill that room.""After listening to him king felt disappointed and said, ""If I give you throne then you will just gamble away your kingdom.""Then king went to second son. After king reached the second son, he began to feel nausea because of smell coming from that room. King asked his son, ""Where the smell is coming from?""Second son replied, ""Dad.. that all I could get in 100rs. I filled this room with garbage because of which this bad smell is coming from room.""King again felt disappointed and left. Now king went to his youngest son. After reaching his room king felt good because of fragrance coming from his room. He asked his son, ""What did you bought with that 100 rs?""His third son pulled a match out of the box and striking the side, lit a match, immediately illuminating the room with light and said, ""Dad.. I bought some candle and scent to fill whole room with light and fragrance..""King was happy to see his younger son and decided to give his kingdom to his youngest son.

300,"Once a toothpaste factory had a problem with its packaging and because of packaging problem some empty boxes were shipped without tube inside. Production line designing engineers knew it was quiet difficult to have exact precision of packing tube into pack with perfection every time. They also knew it was very necessary to sort out this problem so that people buying product don't get frustrated. Ceo new that unsatisfied customers may lead to lower market value of product in market and company will face huge loss. So her gather all engineers from all departments and after all discussion they decided to hire external engineering company to solve this problem of empty boxes. After spending a huge amount and 6 months time the problem was solved. A high-tech precision scale was installed on production line. Once the boxes are filled with tube then it would be sent on that precision scale and would sound a bell and flash light whenever a box weighted less than required weight. Process was like when ever scale rang bell because of empty box then line would stop and someone had to go over there and move the defective box off the line and then press start button to restart the line. Few days after installing that precision scale, ceo decided to take a look on how it was going as he wanted to know if it was good enough. Scale was working fine and it was detecting empty boxes perfectly and now even market share were gaining. After sometime again when he reviewed about working of production line he found out that number of defected boxes picked by that scale were zero. Previously it would pick at least a dozen defected boxes per week but now it was zero. He thought that there must be some mistake with report. He filed a report for bug in that scale and asked engineers to check.

Among three of them one master was a thief. Once while wandering around in a desert I got lost and till I found a way and reached village it was too late. Everything was closed and there was no one outside. At last I found a man who was trying to make hole in a wall. I went to ward him asked him if I could find a place to stay. He replied to that it will be difficult to find a place to stay at this time of night but you cans tay with me, if its ok with you to stay with a thief. I stayed with him for a month. Each night he would say me that, ""I am going to work. you can rest and pray."" When he came back I would ask him, ""Did you get anything today?"" He would reply, ""No not tonight but tomorrow I will try again. god willing.""Even after daily disappointment he never lost hope and he was always happy. When I was meditating for years and still nothing changed, many moments came where I would get so desperate and hopeless that I thought of leaving all this and then suddenly I would remember words of that thief that, ""God willing, tomorrow it is going to happen.

Seeing his own reflection dog barked and ran away. But because dog was too thirsty he would come back. This happened many time but finally despite his fear, dog jumped into water. Seeing this I knew that it was a message from god. It means that one has to go forward despite all of his fears. Third master was little boyas I entered a town I saw a little kid carrying a lit candle in his hands. I asked him, ""Have you lit this candle yourself? "" He replied, ""Yes sir."" I said, ""There was time when candle was not lit and when it was lit but can you show me the source from which light came?"" Boy laughed and blew out the candle and said ,""You have seen light go? can you tell me where it had gone?? "" Boy continued, ""Ok, I will tell you it had gone to the same place where it emerged. it had returned to the source.""This shattered my ego and at that moment I felt how stupid I was.

[SEP] It's your duty to take care of your parents when you get older and matured.","One day a man saw an old lady, standing on the side of the road and he could see that she needed some help. So he stopped right in front of her mercedes and got out. Old lady saw the man even with the smile on her face, she seemed worried. Man could see that she was frightened. Introducing himself he said, ""Mam, I am andy and am here to help. why don't you wait in the car?""Lady had flat tire and it was bad enough for an old lady. Andy crawled under the car and started to fix the tire. As he was tightening up the nuts old lady rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from st. Louis and was only just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. He just smiled and completed his work. Lady asked, ""How much I owe you."" She was ready to pay any amount as she already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. Andy replied, ""I never thought of getting paid. it was not a job for me, I was just helping someone in need. god knows there were plenty, who had given him a hand in the past. he had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.""He added, ""If you really want to pay me back, the next time you saw someone in need just help and give whatever assistance she can give if they need and think of me.""Man waited until she drove off in her car. A few miles down the road lady saw a small cafe and stopped there to grab a bite to eat. It was dingily looking restaurant. As she sat on the table, the waitress came over and offered lady a towel so that she can wipe her wet hairs. She had a sweet smile. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered andy. After lady finished her food, she paid off with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to counter for change of hundred dollar bill but till time she came back lady went. Then she noticed something written on the napkin. There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote: ""You don't owe me anything. I have been there too. somebody once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. if you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: do not let this chain of love end with you.""Under the napkin were four more $100 bills. That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it? With the baby due next month, it was going to be hard. She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low, ""Everything's going to be all right. I love you, andy.""

344,"When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I've got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.  suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn't seem to be annoyed by my words, instead, she asked me softly, why?  I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to jane. I didn't love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake in my company.  she glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved jane so dearly. Finally, she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me, her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn't have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with jane.  when I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions.  she didn't want anything from me but needed a month's notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month, we both try to live as normal a life as possible. Her reason for this conditions was simple.  our son had his exams in a month's time and she didn't want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day.  she requested that everyday for the month's duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told jane about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don't tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young anymore. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me.  on the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn't tell jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily.  suddenly it hit me. She had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, dad, it's time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last-minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn't noticed that our life lacked intimacy.  I drove to the office and jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind.  I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, sorry, jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, jane, I said, I won't divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of our lives, not because we didn't love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death does us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away.  at the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, ""I'll carry you out every morning until death does us apart"". That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run upstairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting cancer for months and I was so busy with jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push through with the divorce. At least, in the eyes of our son- I'm a loving husband. [SEP] The money you spend on friends is returned or reciprocated in some form or the other.

Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.  suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn't seem to be annoyed by my words, instead, she asked me softly, why?  I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to jane. I didn't love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake in my company.  she glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved jane so dearly. Finally, she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me, her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn't have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with jane.  when I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions.  she didn't want anything from me but needed a month's notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month, we both try to live as normal a life as possible. Her reason for this conditions was simple.  our son had his exams in a month's time and she didn't want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day.  she requested that everyday for the month's duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told jane about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don't tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young anymore. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me.  on the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn't tell jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily.  suddenly it hit me. She had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, dad, it's time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last-minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn't noticed that our life lacked intimacy.  I drove to the office and jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind.  I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, sorry, jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, jane, I said, I won't divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of our lives, not because we didn't love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death does us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away.  at the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, ""I'll carry you out every morning until death does us apart"". That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run upstairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting cancer for months and I was so busy with jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push through with the divorce. At least, in the eyes of our son- I'm a loving husband. [SEP] Better humble security than gilded danger.",4

351,"There was this guy who believed very much in true love and decided to take his time to wait for his right girl to appear. He believed that there would definitely be someone special out there for him, but none came. Every year at christmas, his ex-girlfriend would return from vancouver to look him up. He was aware that she still held some hope of re-kindling the past romance with him. He did not wish to mislead her in any way. So he would always get one of his girl friends to pose as his steady whenever she came back. That went on for several years and each year, the guy would get a different girl to pose as his romantic interest. So whenever the ex-girlfriend came to visit him, she would be led into believing that it was all over between her and the guy. The girl took all those rather well, often trying to casually tease him about his different girlfriends, or so, as it seemed! In fact, the girl often wept in secret whenever she saw him with another girl, but she was too proud to admit it. Still, every christmas, she returned, hoping to re-kindle some form of romance. But each time, she returned to vancouver feeling disappointed. Finally, she decided that she could not play that game any longer. Therefore, she confronted him and professed that after all those years, he was still the only man that she had ever loved. Although the guy knew of her feelings for him, he was still taken back and have never expected her to react that way. He always thought that she would slowly forget about him over time and come to terms that it was all over between them. Although he was touched by her undying love for him and wanted so much to accept her again, he remembered why he rejected her in the first place-she was not the one he wanted. So he hardened his heart and turned her down cruelly. Since then, three years have passed and the girl never returned anymore. They never even wrote to each other. The guy went on with his life… still searching for the one but somehow deep inside him, he missed the girl. On the christmas of 1995, he went to his friend's party alone. ""Hey, how come all alone this year? where are all your girlfriends? what happened to that vancouver babe who joins you every christmas?"", asked one of his friends. He felt warm and comforted by his friend's queries about her still, he just surged on. Then, he came upon one of his many girlfriends whom he once requested to pose as his steady. He wanted so much to ignore her ….. Not that he was impolite, but because at that moment, he just didn't feel comfortable with those girlfriends anymore. It was almost like he was being judged by them. The girl saw him and shouted across the floor for him. Unable to avoid her, he went up to acknowledge her. ""Hi… how are you? enjoying the party?"" The girl asked. ""Sure… yeah!"", he replied. She was slightly tipsy… must be from the whiskey on her hand. She continued, ""Why? don't you need someone to pose as your girlfriend this year?"" Then he answered, ""No, there is no need for that anymore.""Before he can continue, he was interrupted, ""Oh yes! must have found a girlfriend! you haven't been searching for one for the past years, right?"" The man looked up as if he has struck gold, his face beamed and looked directly at the drunken girl. He replied, ""Yes… you are right! I haven't been looking foranyone for the past years.""With that, the man darted across the floor and out the door, leaving the lady in much bewilderment. He finally realized that he has already found his dream girl, and she was… the vancouver girl all along! The drunken lady has said something that awoken him. All along he has found his girl. That was why he did not bother to look further when he realized she was not coming back. It was not any specific girl he was seeking! It was the perfection that he wanted, and yes… perfection! A relationship is something both parties should work on. Realizing that he had let away someone so important in his life, he decided to call her immediately. His whole mind was flooded with fear. He was afraid that she might have found someone new or no longer had the same feelings anymore… for once, he felt the fear of losing someone. As it was christmas eve, the line was quite hard to get through, especially an overseas call. He tried again and again, never giving up. Finally, he got through…. Precisely at 1200 midnight. He confessed his love for her and the girl was moved to tears. It seemed that she never got over him! Even after so long, she was still waiting for him, never giving up. He was so excited to meet her and to begin his new chapter of their lives. He decided to fly to vancouver to join her. It was the happiest time of their lives! But their happy time was short-lived. Two days before he was supposed to fly to vancouver, he received a call from her father. She had a head-on car collision with a drunken driver. She passed away after 6 hours in a coma. The guy was devastated, as it was a complete loss. Why did fate play such cruel games with him? He cursed the heaven for taking her away from him, denying even one last look at her! How cruel he cursed! How he damned the gods…!! How he hated himself… for taking so long to realize his mistake!!  that was in 1996.

He confessed his love for her and the girl was moved to tears. It seemed that she never got over him! Even after so long, she was still waiting for him, never giving up. He was so excited to meet her and to begin his new chapter of their lives. He decided to fly to vancouver to join her. It was the happiest time of their lives! But their happy time was short-lived. Two days before he was supposed to fly to vancouver, he received a call from her father. She had a head-on car collision with a drunken driver. She passed away after 6 hours in a coma. The guy was devastated, as it was a complete loss. Why did fate play such cruel games with him? He cursed the heaven for taking her away from him, denying even one last look at her!

You may painfully regret, only to realize that it is too late.","There was this guy who believed very much in true love and decided to take his time to wait for his right girl to appear. He believed that there would definitely be someone special out there for him, but none came. Every year at christmas, his ex-girlfriend would return from vancouver to look him up. He was aware that she still held some hope of re-kindling the past romance with him. He did not wish to mislead her in any way. So he would always get one of his girl friends to pose as his steady whenever she came back. That went on for several years and each year, the guy would get a different girl to pose as his romantic interest. So whenever the ex-girlfriend came to visit him, she would be led into believing that it was all over between her and the guy. The girl took all those rather well, often trying to casually tease him about his different girlfriends, or so, as it seemed! In fact, the girl often wept in secret whenever she saw him with another girl, but she was too proud to admit it. Still, every christmas, she returned, hoping to re-kindle some form of romance. But each time, she returned to vancouver feeling disappointed. Finally, she decided that she could not play that game any longer. Therefore, she confronted him and professed that after all those years, he was still the only man that she had ever loved. Although the guy knew of her feelings for him, he was still taken back and have never expected her to react that way. He always thought that she would slowly forget about him over time and come to terms that it was all over between them. Although he was touched by her undying love for him and wanted so much to accept her again, he remembered why he rejected her in the first place-she was not the one he wanted. So he hardened his heart and turned her down cruelly. Since then, three years have passed and the girl never returned anymore. They never even wrote to each other. The guy went on with his life… still searching for the one but somehow deep inside him, he missed the girl. On the christmas of 1995, he went to his friend's party alone. ""Hey, how come all alone this year? where are all your girlfriends? what happened to that vancouver babe who joins you every christmas?"", asked one of his friends. He felt warm and comforted by his friend's queries about her still, he just surged on. Then, he came upon one of his many girlfriends whom he once requested to pose as his steady. He wanted so much to ignore her ….. Not that he was impolite, but because at that moment, he just didn't feel comfortable with those girlfriends anymore. It was almost like he was being judged by them. The girl saw him and shouted across the floor for him. Unable to avoid her, he went up to acknowledge her. ""Hi… how are you? enjoying the party?"" The girl asked. ""Sure… yeah!"", he replied. She was slightly tipsy… must be from the whiskey on her hand. She continued, ""Why? don't you need someone to pose as your girlfriend this year?"" Then he answered, ""No, there is no need for that anymore.""Before he can continue, he was interrupted, ""Oh yes! must have found a girlfriend! you haven't been searching for one for the past years, right?"" The man looked up as if he has struck gold, his face beamed and looked directly at the drunken girl. He replied, ""Yes… you are right! I haven't been looking foranyone for the past years.""With that, the man darted across the floor and out the door, leaving the lady in much bewilderment. He finally realized that he has already found his dream girl, and she was… the vancouver girl all along! The drunken lady has said something that awoken him. All along he has found his girl. That was why he did not bother to look further when he realized she was not coming back. It was not any specific girl he was seeking! It was the perfection that he wanted, and yes… perfection! A relationship is something both parties should work on. Realizing that he had let away someone so important in his life, he decided to call her immediately. His whole mind was flooded with fear.

354,"A water bearer in india had two large pots, each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck.

355,"A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion. One day he told his sons to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the fagot into the hands of each of them in succession and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength and were not able to do it. He next opened the fagot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: ""My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as strong as this fagot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies, but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.""
