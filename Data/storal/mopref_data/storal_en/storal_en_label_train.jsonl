A person, at his death, left three daughters; one handsome, and hunting for the men with her eyes; the second, an industrious spinner of wool, frugal, and fond of a country life; the third, given to wine, and very ugly. Now the old man made their mother his heir, on this condition, that she should distribute his whole fortune equally among the three, but in such a manner that they should not possess or enjoy what was given them; and further, that as soon as they should cease to have the property which they had received, they should pay over to their mother a hundred thousand sesterces. The rumour spreads all over athens. The anxious mother consults the learned in the law. No one can explain in what way they are not to possess what has been given, or have the enjoyment of it; and then again, in what way those who have received nothing, are to pay money. After a long time had been wasted, and still the meaning of the will could not be understood, the parent, disregarding the strict letter of the law, consulted equity. For the wanton, she sets aside the garments, female trinkets, silver bathing-vessels, eunuchs, and beardless boys: for the worker in wool, the fields, cattle, farm, labourers, oxen, beasts of burden, and implements of husbandry: for the drinker, a store-room, well stocked with casks of old 413 wine, a finely finished house, and delightful gardens. When she was intending to distribute what was thus set apart for each, and the public approved, who knew them well; aesop suddenly stood up in the midst of the multitude, and exclaimed: \"O! if consciousness remained to their buried father, how would he grieve that the people of athens are unable to interpret his will!\"On this, being questioned, he explained the error of them all: \"The house and the furniture, with the fine gardens, and the old wines, give to the worker in wool, so fond of a country life. the clothes, the pearls, the attendants, and other things, make over to her who spends her life in luxury. the fields, the vines, and the flocks, with the shepherds, present to the wanton. not one will be able to retain possession of what is alien to her taste. the ungainly one will sell her wardrobe to procure wine; the wanton will part with the lands to procure fine clothes; and she who delights in cattle, and attends to her spinning, will get rid of her luxurious abode at any price. thus, no one will possess what was given, and they will pay to their mother the sum named from the price of the things, which each of them has sold.\"", "moral1": "thus did the sagacity of one man lose out what had baffled the superficial enquiries of many .", "moral2": "thus did the sagacity of one man find out what had baffled the superficial enquiries of many .", "label": 2}

After a keen observation into the king's horoscope, kandagupta started telling the future boons to be blessed upon the king. The king was so happy. He kept on rewarding the saint with gold and silver for every boon told by kandagupta. Now, came the time to say the future misfortunes. The whole outlook of maniraj started to change. At one point he shouted, \"Stop! you filthy soul! how dare you say such nonsense! I order you to say me the time of your death\". Kandagupta replied in a small voice, \"My lord! according to my calculations, my death will take place just an hour before thy death\". The king was stunned. He felt his error.

{"story": "A wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy wolf. So away he hurried to the crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out. \"I will reward you very handsomely,\" Said the wolf, \"If you pull that bone out for me.\"The crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the wolf asked her to do. When the wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away. \"But what about my reward!\" Called the crane anxiously. \"What!\" Snarled the wolf, whirling around. \"Haven't you got it? isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without snapping it off?\"", "moral1": "expect no reward for serving the virtuous .", "moral2": "expect no reward for serving the wicked .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Once upon a time there was a shy and quiet octopus. He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious. One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers. The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish. A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid. Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down! Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!! So the big fish swam away, irritated all over. As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.", "moral1": "showing gratitude is one of the bases of friendship . acts can overcome shyness .", "moral2": "concealing gratitude is one of the bases of friendship . acts can overcome shyness .", "label": 1}

And no matter how much she showed her wonderful qualities, it seemed that everyone was determined to believe that the most important thing about a fairy was her beauty. In the fairy school they ignored her, and every time she flew off on a mission to help a child or anyone else in trouble, before she could say a word they were already screeching and yelling at her: \"Ugly! get out of here, weirdo!\"Despite her being little, her magic was very powerful, and more than once she had considered using it to make herself beautiful.

{"story": "A long time ago, just after he created the world, god decided to take a day off. As all the animals were newly made and didn't know what they should do, god couldn't leave them on their own so he went in search of an angel to look after them. Even though he was a bit useless, perico the little angel so wanted to be with the animals and pleaded so much to be allowed to take care of them that god gave him the job. 'make sure they go to sleep before dark and are awake before dawn. We can't leave the earth empty! ' was the only advice god gave him. Filled with excitement, perico went down to earth and spent the day playing with the animals. He was so happy that it was nearly night time when he remembered that he needed to send the animals to bed. 'come on everyone, quickly! Off to sleep. ''where do we leave all of our parts? ' asked the animals. They hadn't had them for long and weren't used to sleeping with their ears, beaks, claws, noses and feet, which they took off to go to bed. 'I'm not too sure: just leave them there in a pile. Come on quick, it's getting late', perico replied impatiently. Just before the last ray of sun disappeared, all the animals were in bed. 'wow, that was close. I got away with it' thought the little angel. And then, very tired, he went to bed. He woke up just before dawn and hurried to wake the animals. 'come on! Get up! You need to put all your parts on and be awake before daybreak'. All the sleepy animals headed for the pile of ears, teeth and feet to get dressed. But the pile was such a mess and they were in such a rush that they couldn't work out what belonged to each animal, so they all took what they could and got dressed quickly. Once again, they made it just in time, and a very relieved perico, the little angel, went for breakfast. Before he had finished his breakfast, a rabbit came up in tears. It complained that it had been bitten 3 times already. 'why don't you just run off before they attack you? ' said the angel, 'don't rabbits have big ears so they can listen out for their enemies before they get close? ''do you think these are big? ' said the little rabbit, pointing to his tiny frog ears. 'why are you wearing ears that aren't yours? ''because this morning nobody could find anything in that huge pile' interrupted an angry crocodile. 'I had to put these beaver teeth in and now everyone is laughing at me because I can't close my mouth'. 'stop moaning' said the grumpy lion, 'my penguin feet are even funnier'. More and more animals arrived with loads of problems: a monkey with a trunk, a hedgehog with feathers, a bird with a tortoise's shell. The angel realised that doing things in a rush and leaving everything in a pile had not been such a good idea, so he called all the animals together to propose a solution. 'from now on, we'll stop playing half an hour earlier so that each animal can go to a different place where they will have time to put their parts away. Rather than putting all the bits together, we are going to separate them into small groups, noses with noses, ears with ears, claws with claws, and so on. That afternoon, half an hour before sunset, the animals went off and each found a place that they liked. The fish went to the sea, the birds to the trees, jungle animals to the jungle, penguins to the south pole … they left their parts in well-organised small piles and the following morning it didn't take long to find them and get ready. God came back at dawn. Everything was perfect. 'how did it go, perico? Were there any problems? 'even though he was a bit hopeless, angel perico was also very honest and found the courage to tell god what had happened and the mistake he had made. In the end, however, god loved his little angel's solution and the fact that each animal had its own special place. In fact, he liked the new arrangement so much that he decided to give perico and the other angels a part from his favourite animal as a present. And that's how perico the little angel, a great friend of birds, obtained the most incredible wings for all the world's angels.", "moral1": "tidying up your things is not just piling them all up together . it requires time and organisation to avoid future problems .", "moral2": "tidying up your things is not just piling them all up together . it requires time and organisation to formalize future problems .", "label": 1}

His neighbour happened to be looking out the window. He saw the piece of paper fall, and he thought: \"What a disgrace! that guy deliberately let that fall out of his pocket. he's trying to mess up the front of my house, and he's being sneaky about it, too!\" But instead of going out and saying something, the neighbour planned his revenge. That night, he took his waste-paper basket and went to the man's house. The first man also happened to be looking out the window, and saw what happened. Later, when he was picking up the papers which had been dumped on his porch, he found the important piece of paper that he had lost. It was torn into dozens of pieces. He thought that his neighbour had not only picked his pocket, but had had the cheek to mess up his doorway with rubbish. He didn't want to say anything. Instead, he started plotting his revenge. That night he phoned a farmer to make an order of ten pigs and a hundred ducks. He asked that they be delivered to his neighbour's house. Of course, the next day, his neighbour had quite a bit of trouble trying to rid himself of so many animals and their accompanying pong. Sure that this had been a dastardly trick pulled by his neighbour, as soon as the second man had gotten rid of the pigs and ducks, he again started planning his revenge. And so it went on. They continued trying to get their own back on each other, and each time their acts of revenge got bigger and more ridiculous. The dropping of that single piece of paper ended up invoking a rock band, a fire siren, the driving of a lorry into a garden fence, the throwing of a hail of stones at windows, the firing of a canon, and finally the dropping of a bomb which destroyed both men's houses. Both ended up in a hospital, and had to spend quite some time sharing a room there. At first they refused to speak to each other, but, one day, tired of the silence, they got to talking. As time passed, they became friends, until one day they finally dared discuss the piece of paper incident. They realised that it had all been a misunderstanding, and that if they had talked to each other on the first occasion - instead of jumping to conclusions about bad intentions - then none of this would have happened. Even better, they would still have their houses.

Because other children weren't allowed to come near him, he suffered greatly, and spent his days feeling sad and blue. There wasn't much he could do except look out of the window. Time passed, and his feeling of despair just grew. Until one day he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a penguin eating a sausage sandwich. The penguin squeezed in through the open window, said \"Good afternoon\" To the boy, turned around, and left again. Of course, the boy was very surprised. He was still trying to work out what had happened, when outside his window he saw a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first the boy asked himself what that could possibly be, but after a while, as more and more crazy-looking characters appeared out the window, he burst out laughing and found it hard to stop. Anyone wanting to stop laughing would never be helped by seeing a pig playing a tambourine, an elephant jumping on a trampoline, or a dog wearing a pair of glasses and talking about nothing except politics. The little boy didn't tell anyone about this because who would have believed him? Even so, those strange characters ended up putting joy back in his heart, and in his body.

{"story": "Once upon a time, while flying through the air, a stork noticed the sparkle of a ring. It belonged to a rabbit who was getting married that day. The rabbit went inside its burrow leaving the ring outside, and the stork decided to try it on quickly without asking. However, when she tried to take the ring off again, it got stuck on her finger and she thought:\"Oh no! they're going to catch me. I'll have to think of something!\"Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had seen her, she flew off thinking she could return the ring when she eventually got it off her finger. The rabbit was very annoyed to find that the ring had been stolen. But he was a good detective and very quickly everyone in the forest was looking for a bird with a ring. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:\"How embarrassing! they're going to catch me. I'll have to think of something!\"And she quickly decided to hide the ring by dipping her feet in a bucket of black paint that she found near to where they were setting up the wedding. However, as she flew away lots of the paint dripped off onto the tablecloths and onto the bride's dress, ruining them! When the rabbit arrived and saw the disaster, he was furious. Forgetting about the ring, he sent everybody off to look for a bird with feet painted black. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:\"How embarrassing! they're going to catch me. I'll have to think of something!\"And so she decided to bandage her feet and pretend that she'd had an accident. The stork thought that she had solved the problem, but shortly after she bumped into the rabbit himself who, seeing the stork was hurt felt sorry for her and insisted on taking her to the hospital for an x-ray. The stork just couldn't say no. But she knew that if they did an x-ray they would find the ring and if they took off the bandage they would see the paint, so she said to herself:\"How embarrassing! they're going to catch me. I'll have to think of something!\"Given that her house was on the way to the hospital, she asked the rabbit to wait for a moment while she went to fetch a few things. Once inside her house, the stork took off the bandages and wrapped her feet in lead plates so the ring would not show up in the x-ray. She then put the bandages back on with loads of glue, making it impossible to take them off. The stork thought that by doing this she could go to the doctor without being found out and, later on, would find a way to return the ring to the rabbit. Feeling more relaxed, the stork flew off to meet up with the rabbit, not realising that she wouldn't be able to fly with so much weight attached to her feet. As soon as she left her nest, she began to fall like a heavy stone and could do nothing to stop herself from crashing to the ground. However, she didn't land on the ground. Instead, she landed on the poor rabbit, who had no time to get out of the way. Ambulances, police, doctors and hundreds of animals rushed to the scene and asked the stork how she had come to fall on the rabbit. When they found the bandages, the lead, the paint and the ring, they all thought the fall was the final part of the storks' cruel plan to ruin the rabbit's wedding. In one single morning, the stork had become the most hated animal in the whole forest and lost all her friends. Only after a long time did the rabbit dare visit the stork and he still couldn't understand why she had insisted on ruining his wedding. Full of remorse, the stork begged the rabbit for forgiveness and told him the story of the ring and everything that had happened afterwards. \"I would never have imagined that all this could happen just because you tried the ring on without permission\", said the rabbit laughing. \"It wasn't even because of that\" The embarrassed stork replied. \"It was everything I had to do to hide the ring over and over again. you wouldn't have been as annoyed if you had found me trying it on and had to help me take it off.\"Seeing that the stork had learned her lesson, the rabbit publicly forgave her so she could get her friends back and tell her story, which helped everyone understand that the truly worst thing about telling little lies are the bigger lies that have to be invented to cover them up.", "moral1": "las pequenas mentiras y ocultamientos son tan malos como los grandes , porque para ocultarlos siempre obligan a crear nuevas y mayores mentiras .", "moral2": "las pequenas mentiras y ocultamientos daughter tan malos como los grandes , porque para ocultarlos siempre obligan a crear nuevas y mayores mentiras .", "label": 1}
{"story": "The day when the jobs were handed out was one of the most exciting for all the children in the class. It took place during the first week of the term. On that day, every boy and girl was given a job for which they would be responsible for the rest of that school year. As with everything, some jobs were more interesting than others, and the children were eager to be given one of the best ones. When giving them out, the teacher took into account which pupils had been most responsible during the previous year, and those children were the ones who most looked forward to this day. Among them rita stood out. She was a kind and quiet girl; and during the previous year she had carried out the teacher's instructions perfectly. All the children knew rita was the favourite to be given the best job of all: to look after the class dog. But that year there was a big surprise. Each child received one of the normal jobs, like preparing the books or the radio for the lessons, telling the time, cleaning the blackboard, or looking after one of the pets. But rita's job was very different. She was given a little box containing some sand and one ant. And even though the teacher insisted that this ant was a very special ant, rita could not help feeling disappointed. Most of her classmates felt sorry for her. They sympathised with her, and remarked at how unfair it was that she had been given that job. Even her father became very angry with the teacher, and, as an act of protest, he encouraged rita to pay no attention to this insignificant pet. However, rita, who liked her teacher very much, preferred to show the teacher her error by doing something special with that job of such little interest. \"I will turn this little task into something great,\" Rita said to herself. So it was that rita started investigating all about her little ant. She learned about the different species, and studied everything about their habitats and behaviour. She modified the little box to make it perfect for the ant. Rita gave the ant the very best food, and it ended up growing quite a bit bigger than anyone had expected…one day in spring, when they were in the classroom, the door opened, revealing a man who looked rather important. The teacher interrupted the class with great joy, and said,\"This is doctor martinez. he has come to tell us a wonderful piece of news, isn't that right?\" \"Exactly\". Said the doctor. \"Today they have published the results of the competition, and this class has been chosen to accompany me, this summer, on a journey to the tropical rainforest, where we will be investigating all kinds of insects. among all the schools of this region, without doubt it is this one which has best cared for the delicate little ant given to you. congratulations! you will be wonderful assistants!\" That day the school was filled with joy and celebration. Everyone congratulated the teacher for thinking of entering them in the competition, and they thanked rita for having been so patient and responsible. And so it was that many children learnt that to be given the most important tasks you have to know how to be responsible even in what are apparently the smallest tasks. And without doubt, it was rita who was most pleased at this, having said to herself so many times \"I will turn this little job into something really great\".", "moral1": "responsibility is to be measured by how we approach the seemingly less important tasks in life .", "moral2": "irresponsibility is to be measured by how we approach the seemingly less important tasks in life .", "label": 1}

The same thing happened with the table, and with everything else that touched the paper. The page grew and grew as it flew around the house sucking up the furniture and paintings. Alicia tried to stop it but just by touching it she too became part of the drawing. When she got over her fright and saw herself inside the world of drawings, she decided to investigate. As she took her first step, however, she felt a strong pain in her leg and fell over. \"What a fall, alicia,\" Said nasco, the dog by her side, or something like a dog, because it had 5 legs and was covered in white spots that hadn't been coloured in. \"Didn't you realise that you're missing a foot?\"It was true.

She was still thinking how to get out when, through the uncoloured holes in the wall, she saw strange beings starting to surround the house. After a brief silence, they threw themselves at the house, trying to enter, and eventually one of them took advantage of a big uncoloured hole to get in. \"I should have coloured the walls better,\" Alicia thought as she recognized the attacker. It was a black monster full of blotches that she drew one day when she was in a bad mood. More monsters followed him through the same hole and alicia only had time to flee, hopping after nasco.. \"Follow me,\" Said the dog, \"Piko can help us.\"Alicia looked at him, surprised. Piko was only a little songbird. \"You're thinking it's small, aren't you? I think you've forgotten how you drew it…\"When they entered the living room they saw a gigantic bird trapped in a tiny cage. Alicia quickly freed it, and piko lifted the girl and the dog into the air just before the monsters fell on them. \"Through the window, piko!\" Ordered the dog. \"We will be safer outside the house\". Piko escaped through the window and flew around looking for the rest of the family. Then alicia spotted her pencil close to home and pointed out to the bird where to set her down. Once on the ground, the girl picked up the pencil and ran towards the house. She got there just in time to colour in the spots she missed in the wall and left the monsters trapped inside. \"Good!\" Shouted nasco and piko. Then alicia, looking at how much she had rushed to finish her drawing, took the pencil and started to finish it off, correcting her errors. But her elbowless arm failed her and the pencil fell to the ground, drawing a little black dot. \"Oh no!\" Said nasco. \"What's wrong with the dot?\" Asked piko\"Well… it's not a dot… it's a black hole!\"And the moment the black hole started to grow and grow, absorbing everything with such force that nothing could escape its darkness. Alicia appeared back at her table, together with her drawing and pencil. She thought that it had all been a dream, but on looking closer she saw that the wall of the house was now completely coloured in… and she breathed a sigh of relief. \"That was very dangerous\", said the magical creatures from their hiding place. \"Yes, but she has learnt that you can't leave things half done, even if they don't seem important. and this has turned her into a great protector.\"And it was true, because ever since then alicia finished things as carefully as she had started them, especially all her drawings. All? Well, not all of them, because alicia always made sure to never draw feet on her monsters, just in case.", "moral1": "paying attention to detail and taking your time is the way to do a job well done .", "moral2": "paying inattention to detail and taking your time is the way to do a job well done .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Olav brutolsen was the most terrible of all the vikings. With just his bare hands he could fight a bull into submission in a matter of seconds. To make sure people knew just who he was, his helmet and cloak were adorned with his victory trophies. On his helmet were over a hundred horns, and on his cloak were a thousand precious stones; one stone for each enemy he had defeated. In his city everyone would make way for him as he went by, but one day a young man who was absent-mindedly reading as he walked, bumped into olav. Olav was furious. He reproached the young man and challenged him to a fight to the death. The skinny young man had no choice; all he could do was accept on one condition:   -\"I can't see very well, and I don't know you, so I'll need you to keep your helmet and cloak on during the fight so I can make you out.\" Olav laughed a hearty laugh and disdainfully accepted the young man's stupid condition, before launching himself at the youth, intent on destroying him. The boy was agile, and he only just managed to slip through olav's clutches. The same happened each time olav attacked, and as the fight went on it became easier for the young man to evade the attacks. Although no one could believe how the boy was doing, they all expected him to fall down dead as soon as olav landed the first blow. But that blow never came. Olav had been attacking for more than five minutes, and after ten minutes he fell to the ground, as if dead. Many onlookers thought the young man must be some kind of wizard, but the boy, who was a medical student by the name of virtensen, had demonstrated to everyone how olav's pride and ostentation had been enough to make him fall under the weight of his helmet and cloak. When olav came to, like a good warrior he accepted his defeat. From that day he got rid of the useless trophies on his helmet and cloak, and returned to simple clothing. Now wherever he walked he was just like anyone else. Everywhere, that is, except for when he walked on the battlefield, where he came to be recognised not for his many horns or his bejeweled cloak, but for his unmatched ferocity.", "moral1": "ostentation brings nothing neutral . sooner or later it will become a weakness .", "moral2": "ostentation brings nothing positive . sooner or later it will become a weakness .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Spuddles are small colourful creatures shaped like potatoes. Besides being fun and friendly, spuddles have one very special feature: every time a baby spuddle is born, depending on what colour it is, the baby's parents grow a new arm of that same colour. That arm is the one the parents will use to look after that baby. One day a blue baby spuddle was born, but its parents didn't grow a blue arm. Well, what a problem! How could the parents care for their blue baby if they only had the green arm they had used for the baby's older brother, and the pink arm they had used for his older sister? The first thing the parents tried was to attach a fake arm, but that was useless, and the baby did nothing but cry. Then they asked for help from other spuddle parents, but all of them were using their arms to look after their own children, and nobody could do anything. The parents of the little blue spuddle didn't know what to do, and they were filled with grief that their baby might die because they couldn't look after him. But then something happened that had never happened before. The green brother and the pink sister went to their parents and offered to share their special arms! The parents could not believe they had such generous and wonderful children that were willing to share their arms, despite knowing that if the arms were used to care for their brother it would often mean they could not be used to care for themselves, as they were being used for the baby. Spuddle mum and spuddle dad were filled with joy and happiness that they were now able to look after their baby, and from that day they loved their generous older children even more. And so much did they love their children, and so kind had the little green and pink spuddles been that the the two children each soon grew an amazing multicoloured arm, which they could use to help their parents care for the baby whenever they wanted.", "moral1": "a charming tale to encourage older siblings to be more generous with their younger brothers and brethren , and to prevent jealousy .", "moral2": "a charming tale to encourage older siblings to be more generous with their younger brothers and sisters , and to prevent jealousy .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Tony set off for home again without having eaten. As usual, one of the older boys had taken his packed lunch, threatening to give him a good hiding. On his way, tony stopped at the park and sat on a bench, trying to control his anger. As he was a sensitive and intelligent boy, before long he had managed to forget it, and was busy enjoying the plants and the flowers. He suddenly saw a wasp flying about among the rosebushes, and it gave him a bit of a fright. While getting away from the roses, a thought came into his head. How is it that something so much smaller than himself could frighten him like that? That was just what he needed to do himself, against the older boys! He spent a while looking at the insects, and by the time he arrived home he had a good understanding of the wasp's trick; it was fear. A wasp could never fight a person, but everyone was so afraid of its sting that they left the wasp in peace. So tony spent that night wondering what his 'sting' could be. He tried to think of what frightened those bigger boys. The next day, tony seemed like a new boy. No longer did he walk with his gaze on the ground, nor did he look away when people spoke to him. He was confident, ready to face up to anyone, with his mind on his new role of frightening people, and on his back he carried a backpack full of 'stings'. The boy who stole his packed lunch that day ate an extremely hot sausage sandwich. The sausage was so spicy that he ended up crying and coughing. Never again did he want to eat anything belonging to tony. Another older boy wanted to hit tony, but this time tony didn't run away. From memory, he told him the phone numbers of his parents, his teacher, and the boy's own mother, -\"If you hit me they'll all find out, and you'll be severely punished,\" Tony told him, looking at the boy so determinedly and bravely that the boy left him alone. Another bully wanted to take one of tony's toys. Instead of giving him it in fear, tony gave the boy a small card written by a policeman he knew. It read    -\"If you rob this boy I'll come after you and I'll even lock you up.\" The tactic worked. Just like tony had been afraid of their beatings, those big kids too were afraid of many things. On one occasion, a bully hit him a couple of times, and tony had to be brave and carry out his warning. The bully got such a fright that from that day he preferred to protect tony. So, in the end, tony became like the wasp he'd seen. Without even having to sting anyone, he frightened them, and ensured that no one would mess with him.", "moral1": "even when we 're much weaker , we can defend ourselves from bullies by using what they themselves fear .", "moral2": "even when we 're much stronger , we can defend ourselves from bullies by using what they themselves fear .", "label": 1}
{"story": "There was once a town where the thing everyone feared the most was getting lost at night in the \"Cave of fear\". No one had ever returned from there, and whenever anyone got lost and ended up there, the last that was heard was a great cry of terror, followed by a few enormous guffaws. The townsfolk lived in terror that one day the monster would leave the cave. So they regularly left gifts and food at the mouth of the cave, and these always soon disappeared. One day, a young man came to town, and, as he heard about the situation with the cave, he thought that it was unfair. So he decided to enter the cave and confront the monster. The young man asked for some help, but everyone was so afraid that not a single person approached the mouth of the cave with him. He went inside, finding his way with a torch, and calling out to the monster, wanting to talk with it and discuss the situation. At first, the monster had a good long laugh, and the young man followed the sound of the monster's voice. But then the monster went quiet, and the young man had to carry on, not knowing in which direction to go. Finally he arrived at a huge cavern. At the bottom of the cavern he thought he could make out the figure of the monster, and as he approached it, he felt that something hit him hard on his back. This pushed him forward towards a hole in the rock. He couldn't avoid it, and fell through. Believing that he was about to die, he let out one last cry. Then he heard the great guffaws. -\"Darn it, I think the monster has swallowed me,\" He said, whilst falling. However, as he fell, he heard music, and voices. They got clearer, and when he made a soft landing at the bottom, he heard a group of people shout:    -\"Surprise!!\"Hardly believing it, he found himself right in the middle of a big party. The partygoers were all those people who had never returned to the town. They explained to him that this place had been the idea of an old mayor of the town. That mayor had tried to accomplish great things, but was always held back by the fears of the people around him. So the mayor invented the story of the monster to demonstrate to people how such an attitude was so limiting. So the young man stayed there, enjoying the party and the company of all those who had dared to approach the cave. And what about the town?

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a little drop of water who dreamed of becoming a snowflake and turning the landscape white. Years passed, and then there was a great drought which evaporated the little drop from the lake where he lived. When he reached the sky, he became part of a small cloud. As soon as the weather turned cold, the little drop looked for a nice bit of countryside where he could fall, and help cover the place in snow. But only a little bit of snow fell, and as soon as it touched the ground, it melted. And there the little drop had to remain, waiting for the sun's rays to shine again, and send him back up to the clouds. When the sun shone, the little drop ascended once more, turned to snow again, and down he fell. Again, just after landing, he melted. This happened several times. Finally, the little drop went and joined a great big cloud, where millions of other drops had crowded together. Despite being gigantic, conditions in that cloud were rather uncomfortable. A few of the drops were ordering everyone else around, making them squash up together, amid a great racket. -\"Biggest drops at the bottom! smallest drops at the top! come on, come on! there's no time to waste…\"Our little drop wasn't keen on all this, and he considered falling down to earth again, but a nice, friendly drop next to him managed to talk him out of it. -\"Where are you going?! you don't want to take part?\"Seeing how surprised our little drop looked, the friendly drop explained they were preparing for a big snowfall. -\"All of us here love being snow, and covering the land for days; that's why we've all gathered together here. years ago I would try doing it on my own, but I learned I couldn't manage it without help. I found this nice cloud, where we all help each other a little. and thanks to our teamwork, we've made some of the best snowfalls ever!\"A little later, both drops were flying down through the sky as snowflakes, surrounded by millions and millions of other flakes, turning the green fields white.

{"story": "A greek philosopher was walking along one day, thinking about things, when he saw two very tall women towering away in the distance; they were the size of several men placed one on top of another. The philosopher, as wise as he was fearful, ran to hide behind some bushes, intending to listen to their conversation. The huge women came and sat nearby, but before they could start speaking the king's youngest son appeared. He was bleeding from one ear and shouted pleadingly towards the women:   -\"Justice! I want justice! that villain cut my ear!\"He pointed to another boy, his younger brother, who arrived wielding a bloody sword. -\"We will be delighted to give you justice, young prince,\" Replied the two women, -\"That's why we are the goddesses of justice. just choose which of the two of us you would prefer to help you.\" -\"What's the difference?\" The victim asked, -\"What would each of you do?\" -\"I,\" Said one of the goddesses, who looked the more weak and delicate, -\"Will ask your brother what was the cause of his action, and I will listen to his explanation. then I will oblige him to protect your other ear with his life, and to make you the most beautiful helmet to cover your scar and to be your ears when you need it.\" -\" I, for my part,\" Said the other goddess    -\"Will not let him go unpunished for his action. I will punish him with a hundred lashes and one year of imprisonment, and he must compensate you for your pain with a thousand gold coins. and I will give you the sword and you can choose if you're able to keep the ear or, on the contrary, you want both ears to end up on the ground. well, what is your decision? who do you want to apply justice for the offence?\"The prince looked at the two goddesses. Then he put his hand to the wound, and on touching it his face gave a gesture of undeniable pain, which ended with a look of anger and affection for his brother. And in a firm voice, addressing the second of the goddesses he gave his answer. -\"I'd rather it was you who helps me. I love him, but it would be unfair if my brother doesn't receive his punishment.\"And so, from his hiding place in the bushes, the philosopher saw the culprit get his comeuppance, and watched how the older brother was content to make a small wound on his brother's ear, without seriously damaging it. A while passed and the princes had left, one without an ear and the other served justice, and the philosopher was still in hiding when the least expected thing happened. In front of his eyes, the second of the goddesses changed her clothes and took her true form. She wasn't a goddess at all, but the powerful aries, the god of war.

I will prepare my weapons, a new war between brothers is approaching … ha, ha, ha, ha.\"When aries had left and the philosopher was trying to quietly make off, the goddess spoke aloud:   -\"Tell me, good philosopher, would you have known how to choose correctly? did you know how to distinguish between the past and the future?\"And with that strange greeting began many long and friendly talks. And that's how, from the very hand of the goddess of justice, the philosopher learned that true justice lies in improving the future, moving it away from past wrongs, while false justice and vengeance is incapable of forgiving and forgetting past wrongs, and doing so fixes the future, it always ending up being just as bad.", "moral1": "true justice requires looking to the future and using compassion so as not to turn into just another form of vengeance .", "moral2": "true justice requires looking to the yesteryear and using compassion so as not to turn into just another form of vengeance .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time there were four seeds who were good friends of each other. Taken up by the wind they finally landed in a jungle clearing. There they remained, hidden on the ground, hoping they would be able to grow up and become beautiful trees. But when the first seed began germinating, they realised it wouldn't be such an easy task. In that clearing there lived a group of monkeys, and the smallest monkeys would amuse themselves by throwing bananas at any plant they noticed was starting to grow. Using this game, the monkeys learnt how to throw bananas and they also kept the clearing free of vegetation. They threw so many bananas at that first seed that it was almost split in two. And when it told the other seeds what happened, they all agreed it would be better to wait for that group of monkeys to move on, before they attempted to grow. Well, they all thought that, apart from one, who thought she should at least attempt it. And when she tried she was pelted with bananas, and was left folded over in two. The other seeds got together and asked her to stop trying, but that little seed was completely determined to become a tree, and time and again she would try and try. On each new occasion the little monkeys had slightly improved their aim, and so the little seed ended up doubled over yet again. But the seed didn't give up. Every time they pelted her with bananas, she tried even harder, despite her friends begging her to stop, and telling her to wait until the monkeys left. And so, for days, weeks and months the little plant was attacked by the monkeys, and she always ended stooped and doubled over. For a few days she would manage to avoid the bananas, but then the next day some monkey would hit her, and it would all start over again. And then, one day, she didn't double over. She was hit by a banana, and then another, but none of them managed to make her stoop. She had taken so many blows, and been doubled over so many times, that she was full of hard knots and scars that helped her to grow more strongly than the other seeds. So, her slim trunk got thicker and more resistant, until it could withstand the impact of a banana. And she was already so well developed that nor could the little monkeys uproot her from the ground. And there she stayed, growing, growing and growing. Thanks to the extraordinary strength of her trunk she could continue overcoming all difficulties, until she became the most majestic tree in the jungle. Meanwhile her friends remained hidden in the ground, and they continued as ever, hoping that those horrible monkeys would abandon the clearing, never realising that those very same monkeys were the only ones capable of strengthening the seeds' trunks by their method of throwing bananas, something that would prepare the seeds for all the problems they would confront during their growth.", "moral1": "on the way to achieving our goals , and in the difficulties we overcome , we often develop that which we needed to succeed .", "moral2": "on the way to achieving our goals , and in the easinesses we overcome , we often develop that which we needed to succeed .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Mr. And mrs. Screecher lived in a mad house! The mummy, mrs. Mouthy screecher, couldn't ask for anything without raising her voice. But her shouts seemed like whispers compared to those of her daughter, little squeals screecher. People said that she had made all the cockroaches and creatures of the village flee with just a single shriek. I don't think they were exaggerating, because the truth is that no one could possibly get a moment's rest until squeals was asleep. She asked for everything at the top of her lungs. And then there was the daddy, mr. Silent screecher, a magnificent crackpot inventor who hadn't created anything in years. Well, what would you expect with all the noise? That's why he invented the gobbling-mosquitoes: amazing mosquitoes that were scientifically modified to swallow people's screams. In fact, they did their job so well that no one even noticed the day he invented them because they devoured all his shouts of joy and it was as if nothing had happened. Of course, shouts are just made of air, which doesn't really fill you up, so it wasn't long until the mosquitoes went off in search of food. They didn't have to travel far because just one floor below they found mouthy and squeals, whose shouts were enough to fill them up and turn them into big fat flies. The mosquitoes fought each other to gobble up the shouts even before they came out of their mouths and so, for days, no one heard mouthy and squeals say a single word. When the people of the village saw them, it looked like they were shouting furiously with a cloud of mosquitoes around their heads. \"Poor little things\" The people thought, \"They've finally lost their voices\". \"Well, it's a break for all of us. no one could possibly put up with all their screaming\". But their throats were not the problem. Squeals herself discovered this when she started to grow weak after several days without eating. No one knew she was hungry because she asked for food with such loud screams that the gobbling-mosquitoes that swallowed them up died of indigestion! \"I'm hungry\" She said very softly, when she had no energy left. \"Wow, what a beautiful voice you have!\" Said her neighbour, as she made her a sandwich, \"I've never heard you speak before!\" Feeling better, squeals discovered that when she spoke more quietly, the words came out of her mouth beautifully. People admired her lovely voice and everyone was so much nicer to her. Up until then, people only paid attention to her to keep her quiet. When she told her mummy, she too stopped screaming and they both realised that life could be much happier and quieter. Thanks to the new quietness, mr. Silent screecher was even able to start an outstanding collection of inventions that made him famous all over the world. What happened to the gobbling-mosquitoes? Well, when squeals and mouthy stopped shouting, the mosquitoes became smaller and smaller until they were almost invisible. Just when they were about to disappear altogether, they realised that the world was full of howling humans and that they would never go hungry again. As for you, I hope that you will be clever and it won't be your screams that the gobbling-mosquitoes munch on next! Translated by aoife phillips, saint paul's high school, bessbrook.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a burger who had many lives. Each day she would wake up in the burger bar, and patiently wait her turn to be cooked by the chefs, before being served to the customers. While being eaten, she would do everything possible to make herself really delicious, and with the customer's final bite she would feel like the lights had gone out and she had simply fallen asleep. The next day the whole process would repeat itself. The little burger could have continued quietly living this way for many years if it hadn't been for the fact that, one day, while she was waiting her turn at the cooking range, she heard one of the customers referring to her as \"Junk food\". And, boy, did this make her angry! She was so furious that she almost spontaneously combusted. From then on she realised that many people used that term about her and her sisters. And after listening closely to any radio or television program about junk food or healthy food, she arrived at a horrifying conclusion: it was true, she was \"Junk food\". Now she understood why most of her favourite customers were now much fatter than they had been when she first met them, and why those who came most often didn't look too well. The burger felt terrible; all this was her fault! So she tried to find some solution, some way they could shake off that terrible name. And then she hit on it. Whenever she saw one of the kids who visited almost daily, she would choose the best place to be chosen, and would wait to be served. Once he was with the child, and the important moment wasn't far off - the first bite - the burger would concentrate as much as she could and… nothing happened. The child sank their teeth into the burger and chewed the mouthful just as usual. Then along came another bite, with the burger concentrating as before, but everything happened just as before… several more bites and the burger was about to give up, when she heard the child's voice:   -\"Blimey, how strange! this burger doesn't taste of anything.\"That was just the start of what turned out to be a perfect plan. The burger convinced all her sisters not to have any flavour whenever they were with a customer that visited too often, in return for being even more tasty when the customer came only rarely. In this way they began to see fewer chubby, unhealthy-looking faces in the restaurant, and many of their old familiar friends started looking much better, while getting to eat much tastier burgers. And these burgers became much more popular from then on, because, everywhere, it's more enjoyable to taste something after a while of not having had it.", "moral1": "teaching how to eat junk food richly , and not abuse it .", "moral2": "teaching how to eat junk food sparingly , and not abuse it .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Julian finally left his village when there was no one left living there. He had never left his beloved village before, but intrigued by the fact that everyone had gone to the city, he decided to go and see for himself what wonderful things those cities had. So he packed a knapsack with a few clothes, put on his best smile, and off he went to the city. On reaching the city, he was given a most unexpected welcome. A couple of policemen stopped julian and questioned him in great detail. It turned out that julian had seemed 'suspiciously happy' for someone with hardly any possessions. In the end, the police had to let him go, but they were still suspicious about this apparently simple and good-natured fellow. The first thing julian noticed about the city was all the rushing around. Everyone was in such a hurry that he thought that there must be something special happening that day, which no one wanted to miss. Curious as to what it was, julian started following a man who looked like he was hurrying to see whatever it was that was happening. However, after several hours following him, the man arrived at a small flat and went inside. He had done or seen nothing of interest that whole day. That night julian slept in a park. The park was strewn with bits of paper and plastic. As the bins were completely empty, julian thought how cool it was that the city had seemingly invented plants with petals made of paper and plastic. He only believed this until the following morning, when a man came by and dropped his chocolate wrapper. Julian carried on walking through the city streets, trying to understand what was going on, when he arrived at a group of big warehouses, which many people were entering. \"This must be the best museum in the world,\" He thought, on entering, and seeing all the useless-looking things they had inside. But then he saw that people were picking these things up, paying for them, and taking them away. \"Why would anyone want a watch which doesn't show the minutes?\" He wondered to himself, after seeing a woman very contentedly leaving with the most modern of watches on her wrist. He thought pretty much the same when seeing a pair of shoes with impossibly high heels, and then some electronic device which did a thousand things, and none of them well. Once again, he decided to follow the lady with the watch. He saw her joy turn into disappointment when her friends gave her new watch a look of disapproval. Julian started regretting having left his village, just to come to this place where no one seemed happy. Then he saw a few kids playing. Now, they certainly did seem happy, playing, running about, chasing each other. Except for one child, who seemed troubled by a little machine they were calling a console. He was hitting it so hard with his fingers, and making all kinds of faces and angry gestures, that when one of the other children came over to invite him to play with them, the boy with the console just rudely walked away. Julian thought that the boy was trying to destroy that little machine because it was making him so unhappy. He decided to help the boy. Julian went over, took the console, threw it on the ground, stamped on it, and looked at the boy with great satisfaction. At this the boy flew into a rage, as did all the other children there, and nearly all the adults. They pursued julian so relentlessly that he had to run away. He didn't stop running until he reached the road leading back to his village.

{"story": "There was once a very special little witch. She was special because she was good hearted, but she had no idea how to put that into practice. From the time when she very young, she had been told off many times by the witches. They told her she had to be wicked like all the rest of them. The little witch suffered greatly; she didn't want to be wicked. All her spells were a disaster, and she couldn't find anyone to teach her how to put her goodness into action. So the little witch was sad most of the time. One day she heard that the old witches were planning to cast a spell on a big mountain and turn it into a volcano, which would destroy a small town. The good little witch thought about how she could prevent this, but she didn't really know how to. When she went to speak to the townsfolk to warn them, they threw her out and pelted her with stones, shouting    -\"Get away from here, witch!\"The little witch ran off, and sat crying at the side of the road. Soon a few children came by and, seeing her crying, tried to console her. She told them that she was a good witch, but she didn't know how to put her goodness into practice, and that everyone treated her badly. The children told her that being good was very easy. All you had to do was help others, do good deeds for them. -\"And what can I do for you guys?\", asked the witch. -\"You could give us some sweets!\" They told her, happily. The witch was very embarrassed; she had no sweets on her, and she knew no spell for making them. But the children didn't mind, and off they went to play. Feeling somewhat encouraged by this, the little witch set off for her cave ready to help everyone. However, on her way, she came across the old witches casting their spell on the mountain. The mountain had already turned into a volcano and was beginning to spit fire. The little witch wanted to prevent this happening, but she didn't know how. Then a whole load of magic words came into her head. She said them and, before she knew it, the fire on the mountain had turned into a stream of sweets. The mountain launched thousands of sweets into the air and they fell onto the town below. And that's how the little witch learned how to do good; by sincerely wanting to help others. The children realised that all this had been thanks to her, and they let everyone know. From that day onwards, no one in the town thought of her, or treat her, like a wicked witch. She made friends with everyone there, and did what she could to help them. And in memory of her spell, since then they always called her the sweet witch.", "moral1": "goodness consists mainly in helping others .", "moral2": "badness consists mainly in helping others .", "label": 1}
{"story": "There was once a boy called mario who loved to have loads of friends. He showed off a lot, always talking about how many friends he had at school, and how he was so friendly with everyone. One day his grandfather said to him, -\"Mario, I bet you a big bag of popcorn you don't have as many friends as you think. I'm sure many of them are nothing more than companions, acquaintances, or partners in crime.\"Mario accepted the bet without hesitation. However, he wasn't sure how he could test whether or not his schoolmates were real friends, so he asked his grandpa. The old man answered, -\"I have just exactly what you need, it's in the attic. wait here a minute.\" Grandpa left, soon returning as though carrying something in his hand, but mario could see nothing there. -\"Take it. it's a very special chair. because it's invisible it's rather tricky to sit on, but if you take it to school and you manage to sit on it, you'll activate its magic and you'll be able to tell who your real friends are.\"Mario, brave and determined, took the strange invisible chair and set off for school. At break time he asked everyone to form a circle, and he put himself in the middle, with his chair. -\"Nobody move. you're about to see something amazing.\" And mario attempted sitting on the chair. Having difficulty seeing it, he missed and fell straight onto his backside. Everyone had a pretty good laugh. -\"Wait, wait, just a slight technical problem,\" He said, making another attempt. But again he missed the seat, causing more surprised looks, and a few cat calls. Mario wouldn't be beaten. He kept trying to sit on the magic chair, and kept falling to the ground… until, suddenly, he tried again and didn't fall. This time he sat, hovering in mid-air…then it was that he finally experienced the magic that his grandfather had been talking about. Looking around, mario saw george, lucas, and diana - three of his best friends - holding him up, so he wouldn't fall. Meanwhile, many others he had thought of as friends had done nothing but make fun of him, enjoying each and every fall. And there the show came to an end. Leaving with his three friends, he explained to them how his grandfather had so cleverly thought of a way to show him that true friends are those who care for us, and not just any acquaintance who happens to be passing by. Even less would a friend be someone who takes joy in our misfortunes. That evening the four children went to see mario's grandpa to pay out the bet. They had a great time listening to stories, and eating popcorn until fit to burst. And, from then on, they used the magic chair test on quite a few occasions.

{"story": "There was once a forest made up of tiny trees that were all growing up together. They had been planted by a very old labourer who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was battered by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the bothersome gusts, so they bent their trunks and branches to shelter themselves. The old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, set about straightening them out, and spent many hours tying their slim trunks to supporting posts, hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees had no desire to put up with all that wind. It mattered not to them that the old man would promise them that when they were tall and upright the air wouldn't bother them a jot. They always got by by bending and twisting themselves, hiding from the wind. Only one of those trees, one located right in the middle of the forest, forced itself to grow up straight, patiently bearing the annoying gusts. The years passed, and the old man died. And from then on the trees could grow however they liked, bending and crouching from the wind just as they pleased, with no one bothering them about it. All, that is, except the single straight tree in the centre of the forest, who remained determined to grow up just as a tree should. But as the forest grew, and the trees got thicker and stronger, they began to hear cracks from inside. Their branches and trunks needed to keep growing, but the trees were so twisted that the inexorable growth they were experiencing only brought them pain and suffering, even more than the suffering they had avoided by staying out of the wind. Each day and night, in the depths of the forest, one could hear the cracking and snapping of the trees, and it sounded like groans and sobbing. And around that area the place became known as the wailing forest. And it was a place with a special charm since, right in its centre, surrounded by thousands of short, knotty, twisted trees, rose one impressive tree that was long and straight like no other. And that tree, the only one that never creaked or cracked, continued growing and growing, without a worry for the capricious wind and its accomplice, the breeze.", "moral1": "a metaphor about good posture for children , looking at possible present consequences of too much comfort .", "moral2": "a metaphor about good posture for children , looking at possible future consequences of too much comfort .", "label": 2}
{"story": "There was once a clown named lemon. He was a lot of fun, but also very careless. Whenever he did anything, he almost always ended up tearing his jacket, getting a hole in his sock, or ripping the knee of his trousers. Everyone said he should take more care, but lemon found that really boring. So, one day, he had the happy idea of buying himself a sewing machine. This machine was so fantastic that it sewed everything up within a moment. It seemed like lemon wouldn't have to worry about his things anymore. Soon, the most important day in lemon's life arrived. It was the day when everyone in town prepared a party for him, in celebration of lemon's many years of service in making the citizens chuckle. On that day he wouldn't have to wear his colourful clown suit. That day he would be dressed like anyone else; very elegantly in his suit, and everyone commenting on his smart appearance. However, the night before, he had a look in his closet, and there wasn't a single suit in good condition. They were all ripped and torn, with dozens of stitching marks. Lemon couldn't possibly go to the party dressed in those. Well, lemon was sharp and quick-witted, and he solved this problem by attending the gala celebration in his usual clown suit. That definitely amused the audience, but lemon wasn't as keen on it. He had dreamed of being, just for one day in the year, the hero of the show, and not just the clown. Very early the next day, lemon replaced all those damaged old suits, and since then, he has looked after his clothes with great care.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a precious sword. Now, this sword belonged to a great king, and for as long as anyone could remember, the king spent all his time in his palace, enjoying his shows and parties. One day a great dispute broke out between this king and the king of a neighbouring country. It ended with both declaring war. The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell. Many were half dead and scattered on the ground, bleeding from multiple wounds…at this, the sword realised it liked neither wars nor battles. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the king's sword what it was doing. It told them \"I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war\". One answered, \"No one likes it, but what can we do?\"\"Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing\", said the king's sword. \"If we make enough noise no one will sleep.\"So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise became deafening. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, joined the protest. The next morning, when the battle should have begun, not a single soldier was ready to fight. No one had managed to get even a wink of sleep, not even the kings or the generals. So they spent the whole day catching up on sleep. During the evening they started to wake up, and decided to put off the battle for the next day. However, the weapons, led by the king's sword, spent the night repeating their peace song, and again no soldier could rest. The battle had to be postponed yet again, and this carried on for the next seven days. On the evening of the seventh day, the kings of the two armies met to see what they could do about the situation. Both were furious from their previous dispute, but after being together for a while they started to discuss their sleepless nights, the surprise on their soldier's faces, the confusion of day with night, and the amusing situations all this had created. It wasn't long before both were laughing, like friends, at these little stories. Fortunately, they forgot their old disputes and they put an end to the war, each returning to their own land with the double joy of not having had to fight, and having regained a friend. And from then on, from time to time the kings would meet up to talk about their experiences as kings. They now understood that the things which united them were much more numerous than anything that set them apart from each other.", "moral1": "two ideas . that wars and battles are not romantic , and that we can all do something to bring about peace .", "moral2": "two ideas . that wars and battles are not romantic , and that we can all do something to bring about war .", "label": 1}

The tiny star was very curious, and always wanted to know what was going on. She wanted to travel around to see for herself, but her parents told her that she was still too little to go off on her own, and that she would have to wait. One day, the star saw a little blue planet. The planet looked so lovely that the tiny star forgot her parents' rules, and off she went to get a better look at it. But she flew so fast, so incredibly fast, that she soon got lost, and didn't know where home was. When she arrived on the blue planet, which was the earth, the people and animals thought she was a very bright firefly, and everyone wanted to catch her. She fled as fast she could, frightened, and she hid herself under a sheet. Seeing the sheet moving, everyone thought that she was a ghost, and they ran off terrified. The little star used her new disguise to have fun, scaring the living daylights out of everyone she met. As she went on she arrived at a mountain, where a great dragon lived. The little star tried to scare the dragon too, but she didn't know that it was a ghost-eating dragon. She only got a whiff of this when she found herself surrounded by the flames that the dragon had spit at her.

{"story": "August heat was a little city mouse who lived peacefully in a big house. The house had all the comforts any mouse could ever dream of; there was always warm water to bathe in, hot food, plenty of clothes and whatever else. A rather unusual kind of mouse lived with august. His name was percy veering, and despite all those comforts, every day he would give something up. He could quite easily wash in cold water as if it were warm, or chew leeks as though they were lumps of cheese. The worst was when he tried to convince august that acting in this way would be for his own good. \"Come on, man, you'll make yourself stronger. you're becoming a real softy!\", percy would say to him. And poor august would turn away, snuggle into his blanket, and read a good book, wondering how there could be such stupid people around. Misfortune would have it that, one night, so much snow fell on the city that our two friends' little mouse-house was completely snowed in and cut off from the outside world. They tried to get out, but the cold was intense, and they didn't think they could dig a tunnel through so much snow. They decided to wait it out. The days went by, and still the snow remained; now there was no food left. Percy endured it quite well, but august - deprived of his hot baths, his food, and his warm shelter, was on the verge of losing control. He was a cultured kind of a mouse, who had studied widely; he knew that he wouldn't be able to stand more than three days without food. This was the same amount of time they had worked out they would need to dig a tunnel through the snow. They now had no choice but to get digging. But as soon as he touched that cold snow, august turned away. He couldn't do it. Not with something so terribly cold, not even as hungry as he was, not even knowing that he would soon die! Percy, though, managed it quite well, and started digging, all the time encouraging his friend to do the same. But august was paralysed; he just could not stand such terrible conditions. He couldn't even think straight. Then he looked at percy, 'that idiot', and understood that that mouse was a lot wiser than he looked. Unlike himself, percy had trained himself to do things because he really wanted to do them, and not just because they were the most appealing things to do at any given moment. He could order his legs to dig regardless of whether they were purple with cold - something which was impossible for august, no matter how much he wanted to do it. And with those thoughts, and a tear of helplessness, he lay down upon the mountain of feathers that was his bed, ready to let himself die. When he opened his eyes, he thought he was in heaven; the face of an angel was smiling at him. But then with great joy he realised that it was just a nurse. She told him they had been treating him for days, ever since a very brave mouse had arrived at the hospital, his four legs frozen, and given instructions on where to find august. Then the brave mouse had passed out. When august ran to thank percy for all his help, he found him standing up, having greatly recovered. Percy had lost several fingers, and an ear, but he looked cheerful enough. August felt very guilty since he hadn't lost a thing. Percy told him, \"Don't worry, if it hadn't been for those fingers and that ear, I wouldn't be here either. what better use could they have had?!\"Of course, they continued to be great friends, but august no longer thought of percy as an idiot. By percy's side he set about regaining control over his own pampered and demanding little body, each day giving up one of those unnecessary comforts of modern mouse life.", "moral1": "small daily renunciations are what develop strength and will inability .", "moral2": "small daily renunciations are what develop strength and will power .", "label": 2}

I mean, look at me, and how old I am! my soul has been searching for its star for so many years, and still hasn't had any luck. but some souls, like those of the best children or the best parents, know better how to find their star. and that's why they find it, leap onto it, and leave us so soon.\"\"And do I have a soul too?\" Asked charlie, \"Is it searching for its star?\"\"Sure, charlie,\" Said grandpa. \"You are your soul. and the day you find your star you'll forget all about us here. you'll be on your way to heaven to have a great time with all the souls who are already there.\"Satisfied with these words, charlie always left his grandpa alone and went happily down to the river.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a giant bathtub that had been dumped in the middle of the forest. It was the perfect home for all types of little insects. They had to be careful of just one thing while living there: to ensure the plughole remained free from obstruction because otherwise they might all drown if rain fell suddenly. The burly beetles were put in charge of keeping an eye on the plughole to make sure that it was never blocked. However, one day disaster struck. The plughole was blocked by something huge, something gigantic - a watermelon! The watermelon was so big that not even the biggest beetle, not even the five biggest, could shift it. In fact, it was so big that not even all of the beetles working together could move the watermelon from the plughole! All the strongest insects tried their very best to move the watermelon but couldn't budge it even the tiniest bit. The smartest insects then tried to use their brains to come up with a way to move the watermelon but they had no luck either. Eventually, the wisest insects started to plan the escape from the bathtub. Amidst all the sadness, a ridiculous foreign ant had the cheek to ask if she could take the watermelon away with her. Very funny, indeed! It took a lot of insects to calm the beetles down and stop them from crushing the funny little ant. But the ant wasn't joking at all! At the end of the day, she returned, this time with thousands upon thousands of other ants. In perfect order, each ant went up to the watermelon, bit off a piece and walked off with it. \"You're not going to get anywhere by doing that\" Said a grasshopper to one ant that stopped for a second to rest. \"The watermelon is exactly the same as it was before you bit your piece off!\"\"Hmmm, are you sure about that?\" The ant responded in a funny accent, as if it had never occurred to her. Then, without giving it another thought, she resumed her journey. However, that little piece must have had an effect. Just a few days later, there was not a single trace of the giant watermelon. From that day on, many of the most difficult jobs in the bathtub became small ones that were easier to carry out little by little.", "moral1": "tasks that seem impossible can be achieved if done little by little .", "moral2": "tasks that seem impossible can be achieved if done little by tall .", "label": 1}
{"story": "That weekend miss ellis handed out another of her famous experiment assignments. Her pupils loved that form of teaching, in which they themselves had to think up experiments that would aid in understanding. Many had to do with science, chemistry, but others - the most famous experiments - had to do with people and their behaviour. And on that occasion the subject was really difficult: freedom. How can one conduct an experiment on freedom? What could you show about freedom through experiments? On their way home, the students discussed these, and other similar questions. However, they had already done a good job on other experiments, and this time was no exception. On monday, the students returned with their ideas for an experiment, and they explained them one by one. All the ideas were very interesting but, to cut a long story short, miss ellis has asked me to tell you only about amanda, charlie, and andrea's experiments - which she liked the most. Amanda took out five different coloured boxes and gave them to the teacher to choose one. Miss ellis gratefully took the pink box, and smiled. Then amanda took out five yellow boxes, and asked charlie to choose one. Charlie, annoyed, carelessly chose one. Miss ellis, amused, asked amanda what the experiment was called. \"I've called it 'choices'.\" For freedom to exist you have to choose between different options. That's why charlie was a bit annoyed, because when the boxes are all the same colour, you are not really allowed to choose. But miss ellis has been pleased because she got to choose the box she liked the most\".charlie had prepared another kind of experiment, a more lively one. he chose two class members. lucas was a bright but indecisive boy, and paul was one of the worst students. charlie made them go up to join miss ellis at the blackboard. then he divided the class into three groups.to the first group he said: \"I'm going to ask you a difficult question. You can choose one of the three people at the blackboard to help you answer it. Whoever gets the answer right will win a big bag of sweets\". everyone in the first group chose the teacher.then charlie said to the second group: \"You will be asked the same question, but before we start you should know that I have given paul a piece of paper with the question and its answer written on it\". amid the sound of complaints from the first group, the second group all chose paul.then charlie spoke to the last group: \"It's your turn. What I told the second group was a lie. I gave the paper to lucas\". amid booing and a few laughs, paul showed that his hands were empty, and lucas showed everyone that he did indeed have a piece of paper with the question and answer on it. and lucas was the only one who managed to answer the difficult question correctly.while the winners were sharing the sweets out to everyone, charlie explained: \"This experiment is called 'no freedom without truth' \"It shows that you can only choose freely if you know the whole truth of the situation. groups one and two were free to choose who they wanted, but as they didn't know the full truth of the set-up, they were not really choosing freely. if they had known, then they would have chosen differently.andrea's experiment was very different. she had come to class with laylow, her hamster, and some pieces of cheese and bread, to prepare a few different tests. in the first she covered a piece of cheese with a glass. and at its side she placed a piece of bread, without covering it. when she set laylow free, the hamster went straight for the cheese, banging his nose against the glass. laylow tried to get to the cheese for a good old while, but having no success he settled for the bread. andrea carried on with some similar experiments, a little cruel, but amusing, in which poor laylow could never get to the cheese and had to choose the bread. finally, andrea put a lump of cheese and a lump of bread on the table, both uncovered. this time, laylow, bored, went straight over and ate the bread.everyone enjoyed the experiment, and while miss ellis rewarded laylow with the cheese, andrea explained: \"The experiment is called 'limits'. It shows that, whether we know it or not, our freedom always has limits, and that these limits are not always outside ourselves. They can be inside us too, as with laylow, who thought he would never be able to get the cheese. Many more interesting experiments were performed that day, and maybe sometime we'll get to talk about them, but what is clear is that miss ellis's students ended up knowing a lot more about freedom than do many much older people.", "moral1": "three short examples to demonstrate essential aspects of freedom .", "moral2": "three short examples to confute essential aspects of freedom .", "label": 1}

Indeed, the cloud grew up, while his country was getting dried. First, rivers dried up, then people, animals, plants, and finally, the whole country became a desert.

{"story": "On noah's ark things were getting a bit boring. Noah and his animals had spent so many days secluded there that they started organising games and activities to amuse themselves. But, with all that pent up energy, the games got rather rowdy, and a woodpecker ended up drilling a hole in the bottom of the ark. As water began entering the boat, the hole got bigger. So, more water came in, and things got a bit worrying. One by one, different animals tried to fix the hole. They even got competitive about it because everyone wanted to be the animal that had saved the ark. The beaver built a dam over the hole, but not even that worked. Everyone was scared, worried that the boat would sink. That was, until the bee started talking. The bee explained to everyone how it was that bees always worked together, as a team, each one doing the job they were best at. On hearing this, all the animals set about working together, each one playing their part by contributing their own special talent. The birds grabbed onto parts of the ark with their beaks, and flapped their wings furiously, lifting the boat up a little. The elephants sucked up the water in their trunks and shot it back into the sea. The fastest animals ran here and there, collecting materials. Those used to making nests took this material and stuffed it quickly into the hole. And so, working together, the animals managed to reduce the amount of water coming into the ark, but they still hadn't stopped it completely. Desperate, they kept asking each other if there were any other animals that could help. They searched and searched, but there were no other animals left in the ark. Then, suddenly, a little fish swam in through the hole. The animals realised that they still had not asked for help from all the sea creatures.

{"story": "There was once a farmer who devised a competition between his dog and his rabbit. He made a hole in one of his biggest fields, and hid a carrot and a bone in it. He wanted to see which animal would find them first. The rabbit was very cheerful and optimistic, and he threw himself into looking for the carrot, digging here and there, totally convinced that he would find it. But the dog was pessimistic, and after sniffing around for a bit, he lay down on the ground and began to complain how difficult it was to find one bone in such a big field. The rabbit dug for hours, and with every new hole the dog complained even more about how difficult this was, even for the rabbit. The rabbit, on the other hand, thought that each hole dug was one hole less that needed digging. When there was no place in the whole field left to dig, the rabbit dug a tunnel to right under where the dog had been lying all that time. There he found the carrot and the bone. And this is how it was that the dog lost due to his pessimism. Because, thanks to his great instinct, he had already found the right place at the very beginning!", "moral1": "many of our natural shortfalls can be replaced by a positive attitude and perseverance .", "moral2": "many of our unreal shortfalls can be replaced by a positive attitude and perseverance .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time there was a kingdom with an ancient prophecy that spoke of a princess without a palace. The prophecy said that as soon as that princess found her palace, she would be the wisest and fairest queen there had ever been. That kingdom had a royal family who had lived in a beautiful palace for generations. But there was a great earthquake which destroyed the palace and killed the king and queen. Their two daughters, princess nora and princess sabina, managed to survive. After this tragedy, nora understood that she, being the elder sister, might be the princess mentioned in the prophecy. Accompanied by her sister, nora devoted herself to finding her new palace. During their travels they met a wise old man who gave them an old key that would open the palace doors. \"I have no idea where the palace will be\", said the old man, \"All I know is that you should try this key wherever you seek it\". And nora went with her sister, trying the key on all the palace doors they found. When there were no more palaces to try, they thought maybe the palace would just be some large important house, but neither did the key fit any of those. Fed up, the sisters lost hope of ever finding their palace. They had spent so much time away, travelling and searching, that no one now missed them. Neither did they have any money or jewels left, and when they arrived at a poor village they had to work in the fields alongside all the poor people who, not knowing that the sisters were royalty, took them in as though they were two homeless orphans. The sisters lived there for some years. They worked hard, and knew what hunger was, and how life could be so difficult, but people loved them so much that they came to be very happy, and they gradually forgot their royal past. One night, while tidying nora's things, sabina found the old key. Amused, she took it to her sister, and they reminisced about their search for their own magnificent palace. \"There still must be some palace, hidden in some little forest, just waiting for us to find it,\" Said nora, with a glimmer of hope. \"Well, you know what I think,\" Answered her younger sister, \"That I don't need anything else to be happy. we spent months travelling from castle to castle to live the life of queens, but I have never been so happy as I am now, even though we don't have much. if I had to choose a palace,\" She continued, joyfully dancing about by the door, \"It would be this little cabin.\" She ended, laughing, and then with a solemn gesture placing the key in the cabin door. Just then, the room filled with lights and music, and from that old door arose a wonderful palace filled with life and colour. The place became totally transformed; there were fountains, gardens, and animals. The village people marvelled at all of this. The only thing which remained as it had been was the cabin door, reminding everyone of how sabina the wonderful - which was what they called their wise queen - had found that in a simple, humble life lay the doorway to happiness, not only for herself, but for all the inhabitants of that land.", "moral1": "happiness is not to be found in the showy and sophisticated things in life , but rather in the right way to approach life and live it .", "moral2": "happiness is not to differ found in the showy and sophisticated things in life , but rather in the right way to approach life and live it .", "label": 1}

Both groups, natural enemies, hated each other to death, and each dragon, when its time came, had to choose one side and join its army. Nearly all dragons decided while they were still young, and trained for years before the big change. But brodek was undecided. And now time had run out. At dawn, his wings would be covered with the dark blue of night or the gold of the sun, and so they would remain forever, and everything would be hatred for the sun or for the moon, without remedy. This was the price of the magic and terrible gift of breathing fire. Because of all this, brodek went to the forest to think, where he hoped to find an answer. But there, sitting in the silence of the night, there were no answers. Just a beautiful white full moon, with pale silver shimmer. And the wind in the leaves of the trees was softer and cooler than usual, as if saying farewell to the young dragon. And night, a deep night full of distant stars …for nothing in the world did brodek want to become a dragon of light in order to hate all that wonder, and he felt his wings slowly begin to dye into the colour of the night. But the night was losing its strength and making way for the first light of dawn. It was one of brodek's favourite times of day, and he enjoyed the pink tones of the sky, the gentle heat of the first ray of sun on his face, the glinting crystal and fire shining on the waters, and the joy that was awaking in the woods with the first birdsong …no, neither did he want to be a dragon of the night and have to hate such beauty. And before tears flooded his eyes, before even knowing the final colour of his wings, brodek flew to the lake, dove in as deep as he could to quench his thirst for peace, and then turned and flew up into the sky, as high as he could, as if trying to escape from the unjust land and his cruel fate. And when he had flown so high that the cold prevented him from moving his wings, he opened his mouth to spit out a great flame, as if to spend it completely, to never have it again. But instead of fire, from his mouth came a thin layer of frost that covered the fields below, as if his desire for peace and the lake water had worked a miracle. And only then did he discover that he wouldn't be a dragon of the darkness, and neither would he be a dragon of the light, since now one of his wings belonged to the moon, and the other to the sun. And every so often, brodek again decorates the fields with his magical frosty breath, as if to remind the world that it is not necessary to choose between day and night when you really don't know how to hate.", "moral1": "a story for learning to ignore and enjoy everything around us , rejecting any form of hate .", "moral2": "a story for learning to notice and enjoy everything around us , rejecting any form of hate .", "label": 2}
{"story": "There was once a frog who lived in a pond next to an abandoned palace. Occasionally a traveling witch would come and stay in the palace. One day, the frog decided to go and have a look at the abandoned palace. He hopped over and jumped up to an old window frame. Instead of being filled with glass, the window frame was filled with what looked like a soap bubble. The frog was amused and wanted to pop the bubble by jumping through it. However, this was no soap bubble; it was the remains of a magic potion. As the frog jumped through it he found himself entering a very different place. It looked like he was entering a very rich person's house. The place smelt nice and was heated. But that didn't last very long: a dog spotted the frog and was about to catch him. Fortunately, with three great leaps, the frog managed to jump back out of the window… only to find himself now in a wonderful pond, full of frogs and toads of great beauty. The pond had an abundance of flies, and the frogs and toads croaked happily all day long. Our frog was neither handsome nor ugly; he was just pretty normal looking. This meant he wasn't greatly welcomed by the other frogs and toads, but he was enjoying himself so much that this didn't matter much to him. He lived there for many days, but one night a group of toads who were sick of the frog's common appearance, grabbed him while sleeping and threw him back through the window. The frog woke up in a dark, dilapidated, cold and uncomfortable bedroom. There was a young boy there, and the boy welcomed the frog with great happiness. Soon the boy and the frog were inseparable companions. The boy looked after him as best he could; he even caught flies for the frog. However, the frog couldn't help thinking about all the comforts of the wonderful pond he had experienced. One night, when the cold was worsening, and the firewood had run out, the frog hopped to the window and leapt out. He came out at the north pole! The frog felt like he was dying of cold, so he quickly jumped back through the window. This time he found himself in a desert, and when he again jumped through the window he was back among the arctic snows. It didn't matter how many times he jumped back and forth, he would always come out at either the north pole or the desert. While he was changing from one place to the other he remembered his good master, the poor boy, and how he, the frog, had been so ungrateful to the boy, and so loving of his own comfort, and how this had meant him ending up in this situation, half dead from hunger, and jumping from the worst of cold to the most searing heat.", "moral1": "we should focus more on what we have than what we do n't , as senseless ambition can lead to us losing everything .", "moral2": "we should focus more on what we have than what we do n't , as senseless ambition can lead to us regaining everything .", "label": 1}

The little hippo decided to bring water to all the sick animals in the area who were injured or hadn't enough strength to go down to the lake to drink. To many his gesture was wonderful, because that year had been very dry, and they were so far from the lake that they thought they would not survive until the next rains. For its part, the little crocodile spent the whole day watching from the shore and acting as a lifeguard, preventing a whole bunch of lost animals from drowning, and they were sincerely grateful and surprised to have been saved by a crocodile.

{"story": "Simon was a small plastic figurine who could be placed in any corner whatsoever of the christmas nativity scene. He was born in a huge factory in china and wasn't very well painted, which is why he invariably ended up a long way from the stable, filling just any old space or being nibbled by the children of the house. Nonetheless, he loved the baby jesus, who looked and smiled at him every day from his crib. His only dream was that one year they would put him near the crib…one night before christmas, mary gathered everyone together. \"We need your help. a big war is about to begin, and baby jesus has had to go away to try and avert it. somebody has to stand in for him until he returns.\" \"I'll do it\", said a lovely little angel. \"I don't think it will be too hard to play the role of a baby.\" That little angel took up its place in the manger and another one had to take its place in the empty spot left. This other angel was replaced by a little shepherd… in short, many of the figurines had to switch places. As a result of the changes, simon ended up as a shepherd, much closer to the manger than ever before. Things did not work out. The angel was lovely and did cry like a baby, but it was obvious that it wasn't baby jesus. Joseph had to ask it to leave and they looked for someone else. Once again the figurines switched places and simon ended up closer still to the manger. The new baby did not play the role of baby jesus properly and neither did the many others who were tried throughout the night. Thanks to all the changes, simon had been moved very close to the manger. He was very excited and helped out with everything he could: brushing the animals, cleaning the stable, fetching water, chatting with the elders, singing with the angels… he did such a good job that when they finally found a good replacement, mary and joseph let him stay there, close by. He was the happiest figurine in the whole world, but there was one thing on his mind: when they had chosen the latest replacement, he had been out fetching water and had not seen who it was. Every time he looked, the baby was covered by sheets and, given that nobody seemed to miss the real baby, simon secretly hoped it was jesus who had returned. One day he could wait no longer and, since it was early and everybody was asleep, he took a peek under the sheets…as he lifted his head out from underneath, a giant tear rolled down his cheek. Maria looked at him affectionately. \"He's not here…\" \"I know\", said mary. \"There's no-one here. jesus's replacement isn't here in the manger, simon. it's you.\" \"But I'm just a badly-made figurine.\" \"You're not that badly made, if you managed to make no one notice that jesus wasn't really here. look, simon, you have done what jesus does best: love everyone so much that they feel truly special. didn't you feel the same way when he looked at you every day? now everyone else gets that same feeling thanks to you.\" Simon smiled. \"Jesus has asked me to tell you to keep the secret. he is still out looking for replacements like you in all corners of the world, to make it a better place. would you still like to be the invisible boy in this nativity?\" Of course he did! And that is how simon joined the long list of people who, just as jesus wished, celebrate christmas by making their little world that tiny bit better.

{"story": "There was once a merchant who, after years of bad business, was cursing his bad luck. A traveller was passing by, and he asked the merchant what was troubling him. Hearing that the merchant was a man of great ill fortune, the traveller opened his knapsack and pulled out a strange-looking device made from two crystal glasses stuck together. They were decorated with strange drawings. One glass was green, and the other red, and inside each glass were some strange seeds, each the same colour as their glass. \"Well, you've just run into some good luck, meeting me,\" Said the traveller. \"This is exactly what you need: two little pots of luck.\"The merchant was somewhat surprised, but the traveller explained to him that these seeds were seeds of luck. The green seeds brought good luck, and the red seeds brought bad luck. The two glasses were joined, and when one filled up, it caused multiple incidents of good or bad luck, according to which type of seed was overflowing the glass. The merchant, thrilled, thanked him for the gift, and hardly managed to hear the traveller's last words, warning the merchant how difficult it was to use the glasses effectively. Expectantly, he carefully examined the green seeds; the lucky ones. Though he wasn't familiar with them, he was sure he could find someone that could sell him several new containers, and so he covered the top of the vessel with great care, being sure not to drop it. Then he looked at the red seeds, and thought that the best way to avoid them filling the glass would be to empty them out, right there. So that's what he did, and off he went, continuing his journey. A little later, he met a woman who, seeing his seed jars, must have recognised them. She ran up to him and asked him for a good handful of seeds. The merchant roundly refused, and the woman left, cursing him under her breath. \"What do they want me to do?\" He thought, sadly, \"I can't just throw away my good luck.\" He continued on his way, and had many other similar encounters. As time went on, the merchant saw that only the red jar was filling up. It seemed more or less logical, because otherwise the jars wouldn't have much power. He just stopped every now and then to empty the red seeds out. However, the red jar was filling up faster and faster, and it reached a point where he could hardly empty it before it had filled up again. Finally it started overflowing. \"Well, that's gone and done it,\" Thought the merchant, \"All I need now is another pile of bad luck.\" He looked all the way back down the road, and saw that the seeds he had emptied out, had grown into great big weeds which had choked to death all the other plants in the area. When the local villagers saw this, they were furious, and set about finding who had caused the destruction of their crops. The merchant almost escaped suspicion, but the woman who he had refused to give seeds to betrayed him, and he had to run from that village through a hail of kicks and punches. And that was only the start of the series of ill fortune the merchant had to suffer. Without doubt, those seeds were extremely powerful, and all that power had backfired against him. In just three days he tried a hundred times to get rid of those jars, but it would never stop his run of bad luck. Instead, he had to find some way to fill up the green jar, and not spill any more red seeds. So he removed the lid of the green jar, to find, to his horror, that most of the green seeds had disappeared… while he was lamenting his poor luck, he took a moment to examine the pictures on the jars. They seemed to be instructions. In the pictures the red jar was always closed, and the green one always open. It seemed that anyone could take as many green seeds as they liked. He decided to continue his journey in that manner. Soon he met a man who asked him for some seeds, and the merchant told the man to help himself. Immediately after this his luck began to change. The villagers, who had been chasing the merchant weren't far off now, but his new friend - who he had given the seeds to - came to the rescue by pointing them in the wrong direction. Similar things occurred with many others he met on the road. The merchant realised that if, instead of throwing them away, he gave the seeds as a gift to others, then the green jar was the one that would fill up. After offering the seeds to everyone, the green jar would begin to overflow. Of course, good luck stayed with him, and wonderful things started happening. One man he helped became a very rich man, and this rich man thanked the merchant in the form of luxuries and expensive gifts. Other people considered the merchant to be such a good man that they put him forward to be mayor. Some time later, the merchant bumped into the traveller who had given him the jars. After greeting him, the merchant told him of his adventures, and he thanked him profusely. But before taking his leave, he asked the traveller: \"Why did you give me the lucky jars? did you no longer want to have so much good luck?\"And the traveller, laughing loudly, answered: \"Don't tell me you still have them! those seeds don't really do anything!… the 'magic' of the jars is pure foolishness: all they do is make some stupid seeds increase or decrease in number. some of them are edible, some of them poisonous, but they have no effect at all on luck. I heard they were invented by a wizard's stupid, clumsy, apprentice.\"\"You what?!\" Exclaimed the merchant, shocked. \"I think it was an old teacher who found them and realised they would be a good way to teach people about how best to use your luck. in effect, keep the bad for yourself, and share the good with others. and, in truth, that is the only way to attract the good luck and avoid the bad, and boy, does it work! when you shared out your bad luck, and tried to keep the good luck to yourself, you were sure that no one would want to share the good with you, only the bad. the seeds had nothing to do with all this. everything that happened to you was your own work. do you see now?\"And the merchant certainly did understand now! And as the traveller walked off into the distance, with the little jars in his hand, he searched the faces of the townsfolk, looking for who, among them, most needed to learn how best to use their luck.", "moral1": "the best way to have good luck is to share all the good things you have . grateful friends are the foundation of your good fortune .", "moral2": "the best way to reject good luck is to share all the good things you have . grateful friends are the foundation of your good fortune .", "label": 1}

The grandparents, aunts, uncles, and parents commented that, behaving like this, the children would never learn to manage their money. So they proposed a special test, in which the children would have to show, over the course of a year, just what they could manage to get with those few coins.

In each one of the small pieces he could read, in tiny letters, 'fool', 'idiot', 'pain', 'bore', and a thousand other negative things. \"This is how I started turning all my bad times into an opportunity to add to my collage. now I like the collage so much that, each time someone makes me angry, I couldn't be happier. they've given me a new piece for my work of art.\"That day they discussed many things, but what the teacher never forgot was how an ordinary boy had shown him that the secret to having a cheerful and optimistic character is to convert the bad times into a chance to smile. Without telling anyone, on that very day, mr. Anthony began his own collage. He would recommend it so often to his students that, years later, they called that neighbourhood 'art town'. Each house contained its own magnificent works of art, made by those cheerful and optimistic children.", "moral1": "idea for everyone , to help see the positive aspect in some experiences .", "moral2": "idea for everyone , to help see the positive aspect in all experiences .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Adalina was no ordinary fairy. No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what's more, she was a princess, daughter of the great fairy queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn't she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings. So, from an early age, adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her. But when she reached the age to become queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work. The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn't even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed. -\"Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side,\" She said with the sweetest of smiles, -\"But I don't know whether you'll be able to help me.\" -\"Of course we will!\" Answered the squirrel, -\"Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?\" -\"Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. or… I'd also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… but I don't have any magic or any wings to keep it in…\" -\"Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! look!\" An old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. It was true. When adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps. For the whole day and night you could see squirrels, mice, frogs, birds and fish leaping through the sky, filling it with light and colour, in a spectacle never seen before and that filled the forest dwellers with delight. Adalina was declared queen of the fairies, despite her not knowing from where such a powerful magic had come. And it wasn't until some time later that the young queen understood that she was the first of the great fairies, whose magic is to be found not in one's wings but within all one's true friends.", "moral1": "strangers are the greatest help for overcoming difficulties and taking us to where we could n't reach alone .", "moral2": "friends are the greatest help for overcoming difficulties and taking us to where we could n't reach alone .", "label": 2}
{"story": "They say that one time someone confused a boy's chubby red cheeks for two tomatoes. And when that person tried to pick the tomatoes he burnt his hand. And that was the least he could expect, because alfie was the most easily embarrassed person you could imagine; and he greatly feared ridicule. Even the slightest annoyance would turn his face as red as a chilli. And so it was, that one day something truly ridiculous happened to alfie, something which almost made him explode with embarrassment. He was with his friend jamie, practicing for a play jamie was going to be in: the three little pigs. After a while spent rehearsing the play, alfie remembered that he'd invited dora to his house that afternoon. Dora was the sweetest, prettiest, cleverest girl in his class. Alfie ran straight to the playground, found dora, and said to her,\"What do you reckon? should we go to my place? I can give you a sausage sandwich…\"And just as he finished saying this, he realised that he had forgotten to remove the mask and costume of the little pig! Dora was speechless. Everyone in the playground started laughing, and poor alfie, unable to react, just thought, \"Earth, swallow me up!\"Suddenly, alfie disappeared into the ground, and found himself in an incredible place. Everyone in that place had wanted the earth to swallow them up! And it was no surprise at all, because the faces of the people there were all covered with expressions of utter embarrassment. Alfie met an athlete who had run a race in the wrong direction, and had thought he had won it by a huge distance. He met a bald young lady whose wig had blown off during a storm, and he met a bride who had stepped on the train of her wedding dress, and ended up rolling about like a meatball. Soon, alfie found out that the only way to escape from that place was through laughter. But not just any kind of laughter; you could only escape by learning to laugh at yourself. It wasn't easy, some folk had spent years there, under the earth, refusing to find anything amusing about their own embarrassment. But alfie managed to overcome this, and learned how to find the humour in those moments of shame and embarrassment. He also learned to use them in a way that made others laugh, and bring them a little joy. When he remembered himself in the little pig mask, talking about sausage sandwiches with dora, he couldn't stop laughing at the whole situation. As soon as he realised all this, alfie was instantly returned to the playground, in front of dora, just where he had left her. But this time, far from getting embarrassed and tongue-tied, he smiled at her, took off his little piggy mask, wiggled his little piggy bottom, and said,\"Come on, cheer up! today I have great ham in store!\" Dora and the others laughed, and from that day on, alfie became one of the funniest kids at school, able to make himself and others laugh at whatever happened to them.", "moral1": "the best way to combat shyness and fear of ridicule is to learn to cry at yourself .", "moral2": "the best way to combat shyness and fear of ridicule is to learn to laugh at yourself .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Ricky lived in a lovely, futuristic house, which had everything you could ever want. Though he didn't help much around the house, ricky was still as pleased as punch when his parents bought him the latest model of butler robot. As soon as it arrived, off it went; cooking, cleaning, ironing, and - most importantly - gathering up old clothes from ricky's bedroom floor, which ricky didn't like having to walk on. On that first day, when ricky went to sleep, he had left his bedroom in a truly disastrous state. When he woke up the next morning, everything was perfectly clean and tidy. In fact, it was actually \"Too\" Clean; now ricky couldn't find his favourite t-shirt, nor his favourite toy. However much he searched, the two items did not reappear, and the same was starting to happen with other things. Ricky cast a suspicious eye on the gleaming butler robot. He hatched a plan to spy on the robot, and began following it around the house. Finally he caught it red-handed, picking up one of ricky's toys to hide it. Off he went, running to his parents, to tell them that the butler was broken and badly programmed. Ricky asked them to have it changed. But his parents told him absolutely not; it was impossible, they were delighted with the new butler, and it cooked like a dream. So ricky needed to get some kind of proof; maybe take some hidden photos. He kept on at his parents, about how much good stuff the robot was hiding. This outweighed however good a cook it was, ricky argued. One day, the robot was whirring past, and heard the boy's complaints. The robot returned with one of the boy's toys, and some clothes for him. \"Here, sir. I did not know it was bothering you,\" Said the butler, with its metallic voice. \"How could it not, you thief?! you've been nicking my stuff for weeks!\" The boy answered, furiously. \"The objects were left on the floor. I therefore calculated that you did not like them. I am programmed to collect all that is not wanted, and at night I send it to places other humans can use it. I am a maximum efficiency machine. were you unaware?\" The robot said, with a certain pride. Ricky started feeling ashamed. He had spent all his life treating things as though they were useless. He looked after nothing. Yet it was true that many other people would be delighted to treat those things with all the care in the world. And he understood that the robot was neither broken nor misprogrammed, rather, it had been programmed extremely well! Since then, ricky decided to become a 'maximum efficiency boy', and he put real care into how he treated his things. He kept them tidy, and made sure he didn't have more than was necessary. And, often, he would buy things, and take them along with his good friend, the robot, to help out those other people who needed them.", "moral1": "treating things well , with care , is also a sign of respect to those who can not enjoy such things , and who -given the chance - would surely treat them poorly .", "moral2": "treating things well , with care , is also a sign of respect to those who can not enjoy such things , and who -given the chance - would surely treat them well .", "label": 2}
{"story": "When the evil witch of the summits imprisoned the seven princesses in the seven castles of the seven mountains, guarded by seven falcons, seven ogres and seven dragons, no one thought they would ever return alive. However, years later, the brave sir pentin joined a veteran band of noble knights to ride to the great summits, defeat the falcons, ogres and dragons, and liberate the princesses. The knights entered each castle to rescue the young ladies. These places were so cold and dark that the princesses looked almost dead. The brave knights wondered what kind of terrible evil there must be in the witch's black heart to have imprisoned the princesses there. When liberated, the young girls were enormously grateful to their rescuers, since life in those cells was the emptiest and most boring one could ever imagine. Smiling, they listened to the knights recount their deeds, and they fell in love with their bravery and fearlessness. But on arriving at the final castle, which looked no different from the others, they discovered a beautiful interior, wonderfully decorated and maintained, filled with light and colour. One could even hear beautiful background music, as though this was some magical place. And when they ran to rescue the seventh princess from her alcove in the highest tower, as they had done with the others, they didn't find her there. They searched everywhere for her until, following the magical music, they ended up in a small living room. They found no magic there, but sat in the room was a joyful princess skillfully playing a harp. Nothing disconcerted the knights more than the young girl's happy and enthusiastic attitude. She was cultured, ingenious, elegant, and had a special gift for the arts. Unlike the other princesses, in whom the effect of their imprisonment was easily visible, the last princess seemed to have lived a much more active and interesting life. Yet, after much questioning and inquiry, the knights could only conclude that she had been equally imprisoned and solitary as the others. Surprised, they searched the palace, looking for an explanation, until they arrived at the library. Many books were missing, and only then did they realise the reason: the whole of the rest of the castle was full of books. On each table and piece of furniture you could easily find a book of some sort. The princess had never stopped reading! And so it was that she had managed to learn and live so many experiences that it seemed, to her, that she had never been imprisoned at all. She had lived her incarceration busy with so many activities that she had never once been bored. The return journey was certainly a strange one. The princesses - apart from the final one - turned out to be so boring and uninteresting that none of the knights was able to return their love. On the contrary, all the knights were very taken by the young clara, who, not being carried away by the knights' deeds or the gleam of their armour, was able to choose her true love, at her leisure, much later on. But then, that's a whole other story.", "moral1": "being bored is always your own doing , some you need is a good book to kill boredom and feed your spirit .", "moral2": "being bored is always your own doing , all you need is a good book to kill boredom and feed your spirit .", "label": 2}
{"story": "What I'm about to tell you happened a long, long time ago, when I went to visit my aunt nina. She lived in an old house, with a great courtyard and many flowers. I loved going to stay with nina because I could play in her garden in the mornings, help her cook, and above all… have breakfast in bed! She always made my bed up on a sofa which stood against a wall in her bedroom. There I used to sleep every night, and as I was drifting off I liked to look at a big damp stain on the wall. I tried to make shapes out of that stain: faces, characters. One rainy night something very strange happened. Suddenly, I saw something extraordinary come out of that wall. It looked like a ghost made of cotton… except that it was dark, as dark as thunderclouds. I felt the ghost touching my shoulder, and as it did so, it turned into a grey lady of incredible beauty. Then, in a deep, but sweet, kind voice she said:   -\"Good evening! my name is storm, and don't let my colour fool you, I'm really a very good fairy. want to come with me?\"And she offered me her hand. It was a slim, transparent hand, and smelled of raindrops. I was so surprised that I could not answer. The next thing I knew, I had been carried by some invisible force, taken from the warmth of my bed, and transported through the bedroom wall, through the middle of that damp stain…    -\"Come on, come along, you'll love where we're going,\" Said the fairy, and with that we moved up, soaring, flying, faster and faster towards the heavens. We meandered through the air while behind us lightning struck and thunder roared, and through all of it I didn't feel the slightest fear. Along I went in complete confidence, holding onto storm's hand, and the rain fell incessantly beneath us. It seemed to come in waves, softly murmuring through the sky… storm smiled at me, and higher and higher we went. Then, just as smoothly as we had ascended, we began to float back down. We descended through a gradually clearing fog, and headed towards an area filled with light. In the blink of an eye we were bathed in sunlight, and around us were seven other figures. Seven more fairies, each just as beautiful and transparent as storm, each as sweet and kind, and they smiled at me just like she had…! Instead of magic wands they each had a slim golden paintbrush in one hand, and a painters' palette in the other. Out from the fog which had surrounded us appeared flowers, plants, animals, all manner of things, but every one of them was completely colourless…each of the seven fairies took their leave of us and alighted upon a flower, a plant, an animal; any object of their choosing. Little by little, object by object, the fairies brought colour to the scene, until finally everything was just as we see it every day. My friend storm painted some chimney smoke, a beautiful horse, several little birds, and a cat that was so plump and gleaming that it looked like a silk pompom… well, I was so shocked by all this that I couldn't say a word. But an even bigger surprise was in store. I turned to look back at the path we had taken to arrive there, and saw that it was nothing less than… a rainbow, complete with all its resplendent colours. Meanwhile, storm and her friends took me by the hands and began to dance, singing a song:   -\"How beautiful are the plants after the rain, the soaked flowers; everything gleaming, raindrops painting in their colours, a fresh coat! we're on light patrol, and this is our song!\"And indeed I danced and sang with them, clapping in rhythm, and wanting to ask the fairies so many questions! When the song ended I would ask them. Of that I was sure. I was just about to let my curiosity off the leash when, suddenly, I heard my aunt nina's voice saying:    -\"So now you sing in your sleep, do you? I think you're in need of a good breakfast. come on, I'll bring you some hot tea, and toast with peach jam, the kind I make especially for you!\"I thought that if I told her what I'd seen, she wouldn't believe me. Then she said this to me:    -\"So you enjoyed your journey through the damp stain?\"As my breakfast was getting cold, and I was going to be late for school, I didn't have time to answer her. Anyhow, I still believe that whenever it rains storm and her friends come to visit us, and they leave everything looking bright, fresh, and new… just as though it had just been painted by fairies.

{"story": "When young nerino was made chief of the tribe, everyone expected that - as was the custom on the island - he would direct his attention to fighting the great fiery-eyed beast; a horrible creature that had terrorised the tribespeople for centuries. Nerino had promised to slay the beast and, though he was a good fighter, he seemed no better than the others who had previously perished in the attempt. The tribe reckoned that, as chief, he wouldn't last much more than a year. This was about the amount of time needed to train and prepare a band of warriors, prior to ascending to the volcano's summit, where their horrendous enemy lived. And once they got there, no matter how strong or brave they were, all the warriors would be annihilated within a couple of hours. However, nothing was done. Nerino didn't train any fighters, nothing out of the ordinary was done, no new assault tactics were devised. When summer came - the time the monster attacked most frequently, engulfing all in flames from his fiery eye - all the tribe did was move their village. Everyone looked worringly and insistently at nerino. They demanded that he fight, that he do something, that he should be brave and fulfil the destiny of a chief. But nerino simply said:    -\"I shall defeat the beast, but now is not the time.\"And so the years passed by, and nerino became an old man. And though they respected him as their chief, and his strategy of moving their village around the island had saved many lives, all the people believed he was a coward. Yet, just when no-one expected it, nerino finally assembled a squad of fighters. He announced this suddenly, without warning, on a cold winter night. Snow was rare on the island, but now it blanketed the ground, and the band of warriors had to march out barefoot, with frozen feet. They hurriedly ascended the volcano and, at the summit, they approached the monster's cave. Nerino confidently entered, while his companions performed the usual death preparation rituals, ready to leave this life…when they were all inside they cave they saw old nerino standing over the beast. The monster was lying, curled up, on the ground, trembling and groaning, close to death. Nerino and his warriors easily took the creature prisoner. On arriving back at the village, everyone wanted to hear about nerino's fight with the monster. Not even the tiniest baby was absent when nerino began telling his story:   -\"I never intended to fight against something so terrifying, and nor did I do so today,\" He said, filling all with surprise and expectation. He continued. -\"Did none of you notice that the beast would never attack during the worst days of winter? or that, after an especially cold spell, his fire was never very strong, nor his attacks very damaging? for many years I was waiting for a snow as heavy as this one. all along, we didn't need fighters; we needed the cold. when we got to the volcano, the monster was so weak he couldn't fight. finally we have put an end to fighting and death. now we have the beast, and his fiery eye, at our service.\"Everyone congratulated the chief for his wisdom, particularly those who had most criticised him for supposed cowardice. And so it was that even the most impatient among the tribe learned that, sometimes, patience can be much more useful than action, even if it means you require the bravery to accept people treating you like a coward.", "moral1": "patience helps to solve problems at the right time , although this sometimes obliges us to endure great pressure .", "moral2": "patience helps to solve problems at the incorrect time , although this sometimes obliges us to endure great pressure .", "label": 1}

The rest of the class tried to work out how carla had managed to create such a great big chain of happiness. All there was in the box was a photo of a big smile.

They had contaminated the whole countryside so much with rubbish and pollution that there were no plants or animals left. One day, a little boy was walking on the planet, when he passed a cave and noticed a small red flower inside. The flower was very sick - almost dying - so the boy carefully dug up the flower, with roots, soil and everything. Then, he started looking for a place where he could look after it. He searched all over the planet, but everywhere was so contaminated that there was no place the flower could possibly live in. Then he looked up at the sky and noticed the moon. It seemed to the boy that maybe the plant could survive there. So the little boy put on his astronaut suit, and climbed into a space ship. He put the little red flower in the back, and off they went to the moon. Far away from all that pollution - and with the boy visiting it every day to tend it - the flower started to grow. The flower was so well cared for, that it had soon germinated, giving birth to others, and these other flowers spread onto other flowers. Before long, the whole moon was completely covered with flowers. That's why, whenever the little boy's flowers open up, for a few minutes the moon takes on a soft red sheen, like a warning light.

The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and… started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there. The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair. The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons… it was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends. And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.", "moral1": "most bravery is without foundation , and plays on what is unknown or different .", "moral2": "most fear is without foundation , and plays on what is unknown or different .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Soppo was an enormous giant, the biggest there had ever been. He could drink a river dry, or eat a whole forest as if it were a salad. And, without doubt, his favourite delicacy was the clouds in the sky; fresh, spongy, the kind he ate so many of that he'd almost always end up with an upset stomach. He'd have such pains in his belly that he'd end up crying, and the flow of his tears created great floods and torrents. Soppo lived quietly and just how he liked, fearing nothing and no one, coming and going as he pleased. However, despite all that he wasn't happy: he didn't have even one single friend. What's more, every time he visited a country, there was nothing but problems: with him eating so many clouds the rains for the crops would disappear and, what with his stomach aches and crying, everything would then get flooded, not to mention all the woods and farms he would eat his way through… in the end, whenever he was spotted, everyone would flee in terror, and soppo never got to spend any time with anyone at all. One night, seeing him crying, various stars came down and asked him why he was so sad. On hearing his story they commented:   -\"Poor giant. he doesn't know how to make friends. yet the earth is the most special planet of all, and it's full of all kinds of friends.\" -\"But, where can I find friends? how do I do that?\" Replied the giant. -\"By giving people a hand or doing something for them. that is what makes friendship. you didn't know that?\" Replied the stars, amused. -\"Gee,\" Sighed soppo    -\"That never occurred to me. what did you guys do to make friends?\" -\"Well, we learned to show people the way at night time, and serve as guides to many sailors. they're great friends. they tell us stories and keep us company every night.\"So the giant and the stars kept chatting a while, and over the following days soppo thought about nothing else but ways to find friends. But he couldn't think of any way to manage it. Several days later he went to ask for help from the moon. Being old and wise the moon answered:   -\"You won't know how to help someone until you know them well. what do you know about these people you want to become your friends?\"Soppo thought for a while, because really he knew hardly anything about human beings. They were so small that he'd never worried much about them. So he thought to himself he would find out about them, and he spent long days observing their little lives. This is how he discovered why everyone ran off when seeing him, and he realised he was causing droughts by eating all the clouds, and that his weeping flooded them out, and he learned a thousand other things that filled him pity and joy. That night the giant ran to greet the stars. -\"Now I know how I'm going to make friends…. by eating and crying!!\"And so it was. From that day on, soppo watched the skies, and when the clouds were preparing enormous storms he would feast himself on some of them. Then, when he spotted some place where there was a shortage of water, he would cry above it. Before long, soppo changed from being the worse that could happen to a country, to being a blessing for everyone, and he was never short of a good friend to spend a while with, to listen to, or to offer a helping hand.", "moral1": "friendship begins from giving to friends without expecting anything in return , and being attentive to their needs .", "moral2": "friendship begins from giving to friends without expecting anything in return , and differing attentive to their needs .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Pancho had met his friend, zero-zero, in an interplanetary chat; and, as soon as he could, he booked a space flight to go and visit him. But while zero-zero was showing him the wonders of his planet, pancho tripped over and bumped his head on a sphere that was lying by the path. After the impact, the sphere opened up, and from out of it came a little man. The little man had an enormous bruise on his head, and was hopping mad. Zero-zero was scared, so much so that he could hardly speak. And before pancho could ask forgiveness, two enormous, uniformed robots turned up. They took out a few small devices and scanned the whole area. When they had finished this, from out of one of the devices their emerged a small metal card that one of the robots presented to the little man. Without a word they grabbed pancho and the little man and whisked them away at top speed. Before he knew it, pancho was locked up inside a large sphere, with the little man and a very serious-looking robot dressed in a black toga. Before knowing what was going on, he heard the robot say: \"Go ahead\". Without hesitation the little man then gave him a lusty blow to the head. After this, the robot took out another device, checked pancho's throbbing head, and finally issued him with a small metal card. -\"Too hard. it is now your turn. do not exceed what is stamped on the card.\"Pancho had no idea what was happening. He looked around him. Through the transparent walls he could see numerous other spheres, each one containing a robot dressed in a toga, along with people hitting and pushing each other, clutching little metal cards in their hands. The little man, standing before him, looked at pancho with fear, and the robot remained expectantly at their side. -\"You may hit him. remember, no more than on the card,\" Continued the robot. Pancho was hesitant. The robot in the toga impatiently explained:   -\"This is a process of perfect justice. you must not worry about anything. both of you will receive exactly the same harm that you have dished out. if one of you exceeds the limit you will receive another card with the exact value required for everything to be equalised.\"Perfect justice? That sounded very nice. No one could come out worse than anyone else, and everyone would suffer what they had made others suffer. Pancho was surprised at how advanced they were on this planet. He was so keen to remark on it to zero-zero that he ran towards the door. -\"You may not leave,\" Said the robot, blocking his way, -\"You must complete the process, you must spend the points on your card.\"Pancho was pensive. He had no desire to hit that poor little man any further, even though it was true that the little guy had really whacked him one…   -\"It's fine. I forgive him,\" He said, finally. -\"No,\" Repeated the robot, \"You must use the points on your card. this is a process of perfect justice.\"What a pain! How could it be impossible to forgive someone? Pancho began to feel annoyed at this rather snooty robot, so he took his card, tore it in two, and said, -\"Look! now there are no points left.\"The robot appeared to break down. It started emitting whistling noises, lots of lights all over its body lit up, and it lost control of its movements. Just when it appeared that it was going to explode, the robot returned to normal, and quietly said:   -\"It is correct. now you may leave. thank you for using the system of perfect justice.\"The door opened, but before he could greet the shocked zero-zero, pancho had to remove the little man from himself, who was embracing him and thanking him as though pancho had saved his life. On leaving the sphere, pancho began to understand. All around he could see perfect justice system users lain on camp beds and looking tired and exhausted. Zero-zero explained that the main problem with the perfect justice system was that it was almost impossible to give out the exactly correct amount of harm, and the judgments and exchanges of blows would end up going on for days and days. So scared was everyone of ending up in the judgment process that many people lived isolated lives, inside small glass spheres, just like the little man pancho had fallen on. A few days later, pancho returned home, but his name was never forgotten on that planet. Previously, no one had forgiven anyone anything, but thanks to him they had discovered that forgiveness is a necessary part of justice.", "moral1": "forgiveness is a fundamental part of justice .", "moral2": "forgiveness is a fundamental part of injustice .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Pete hated losing at anything. His parents, teachers, and many others, said he didn't know how to lose, but the truth of it was that he couldn't stand losing, not even at marbles. It was so great, and he felt so good, when he won, that he never wanted to give up that feeling; not for anything in the world. On top of that, losing made him feel precisely the opposite. It seemed to pete that losing was the worst thing that could happen to anyone. If there was a game pete wasn't brilliant at, he simply wouldn't play it. But if he was going to win he would take part, even if the game lasted only a minute. And the kind of things he was really good at, like table football, you could hardly stop him playing. A new kid started at pete's school, and his name was albert. Albert was a cracking table football player, and it didn't take pete and albert long before they challenged each other to a game. Pete prepared for the match with great seriousness. He was concentrated and intense. Albert, on the other hand, seemed not to be taking the thing at all seriously. He walked about the whole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all sorts of things. But on the football table, albert was a real phenomenon. He scored goals again and again, laughing and joking all the time. However, albert was paying so little attention to the match that pete managed to change the scoreboard while his opponent was looking elsewhere, and so pete managed to win by cheating. Pete made a big thing of his win, but it seemed not to matter to albert. - \"It's been fun. we should play again some other time\", said albert. On that day, people at school talked about little else. Pete's great victory was on everyone's lips. But, that night, pete didn't feel so happy. He had won, but even with that there was no trace of the joyful feeling he usually enjoyed so much. What's more, albert hadn't felt bad about losing. He almost seemed to enjoy it. And, to top it all, the next day pete saw albert playing basketball. He was absolutely hopeless; he lost time after time. But that happy smile never left his face. For several days pete watched the new guy. He was great at some things, terrible at others - to an embarrassing degree - but he enjoyed everything equally. Pete began learning that to enjoy a game you didn't have to have a scoreboard; nor did you have to have winning and losing. What you had to do was enjoy the game for its own sake, trying to do well, and enjoying each aspect of it. Finally, pete found himself playing hide and seek, telling a joke while playing table football, and regretting that a particularly fun game he was playing was soon about to end. And without really knowing why, the older kids started commenting amongst themselves, - \"Good fun playing with pete, that kid sure isn't a sore loser.\"", "moral1": "to know how to win or keep gracefully is important to actually enjoy what you 're actually doing , and not to give so much importance to the result .", "moral2": "to know how to win or lose gracefully is important to actually enjoy what you 're actually doing , and not to give so much importance to the result .", "label": 2}
{"story": "There was once a boy who always treated his mother horribly, shouting at her, insulting her. It didn't matter to him how sad he made her. One day, without knowing how, he woke up in an immense and lonely place. He was sitting on a rock from which four huge pillars rose up into the sky, appearing to support the entire world. He was all alone, but soon an enormous flock of crows with beaks made of steel landed on the rock, and set about violently chipping away at it. After the crows left, a mysterious door in one of the pillars opened, and through it came a charming and pretty girl. -\"Have you come to help us? that's great! we need all the people we can get.\"The boy was puzzled, and spotting his confusion, the little girl explained. -\"So you don't know where you are? this is the centre of the earth. these pillars support the whole planet, and this rock keeps the pillars in place.\" -\"And how can I help you?\" Said the boy, confused. -\"Well, to help look after the rock, of course. anyone can see by your face that you're the best person for the job,\" Answered the girl, -\"The birds you saw are only increasing in number, and if we don't look after this rock it will eventually crumble and everything will come crashing down.\" -\"And what do you see in my face?!\" Exclaimed the boy, surprised. -\"I've never looked after a rock in my whole life!\" -\"But you'll learn how, even if you've never done it. here, look in this mirror,\" Said the girl, holding one in front of the boy's face. The boy could clearly see he now had the face of a bird, and his nose was gradually turning into steel. There he stood, shocked and worried, not a word passing his lips. -\"All those crows used to be children like you and I, \" Explained the girl, -\"But they decided not to look after the rock. now that they're older they've turned into evil birds; all they do is destroy. up to now, you haven't done much to look after it, but now that you know, will you help me to preserve all this?\" She said all this with a smile, taking his hand in hers. The boy still didn't quite understand all this. He looked closely at the pillars and could see that each one was made of thousands and thousands of little figurines, representing the best virtues: sincerity, effort, honesty, generosity…closely inspecting the ground beneath him, he could see that the enormous rock was made up of little instances of children showing respect to their mothers, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and old people. What the crows were trying to do was cover over these instances by carving out scenes of shouting and insults. Next to his feet, he could see his own little carving, representing the last time he shouted at his mother. That image, in such a strange place, made him realise that the only thing keeping the columns standing was respect. Respect was sustaining the world. The boy, filled with regret, stayed there and looked after the rock for many days. He carried out his task joyfully, going without sleep to repel every crow attack. He carried on until, exhausted by his efforts, he collapsed; completely spent. When he woke he was back in his bed at home, and he didn't know whether it had all been a dream. However, what he was now sure of was that no crow would ever again get the chance to carve a picture of him shouting at his mother.", "moral1": "respect is the value that sustains the arena in which all same values partake .", "moral2": "respect is the value that sustains the arena in which all other values partake .", "label": 2}

But then a strange thing happened. When he took the magnifying glass away, the ant stayed the same size it had appeared through the glass. Very surprised, the boy kept experimenting, and he found that anything he looked at through the magnifying glass would get bigger, and stay that way. Suddenly, he realised how he could best use this special ability, and he ran home. At home he took all the candies and sweets, and he made them gigantic with his magnifying glass. Then he completely stuffed himself with them, until he could eat nothing more. However, the next morning he woke up totally swollen, a bit purple, and with a huge bellyache. When the doctor came to see him, he said it was the worst case of upset tummy he had ever seen. Night and day, the little glutton suffered so much that for a long time he didn't want to hear mention of large amounts of food. His parents were happy about this. Thanks to their son's latest gluttony their pantry was full of the food he could not eat. What's more, he gave up being a glutton who only ever ate sweets and candy. He wanted nothing to do with them. And so it was that the little glutton learned that even with the best things in life, if you have too many of them, you will end up feeling ill.

As he didn't know what to do with this discovery, the wizard decided to use it on one of his toads. After the spell was cast, the toad became a very smiley happy amphibian. Not only could he now eat all sorts of foods, but he also started speaking. \"I'm delighted with the change\", repeated the toad, proudly, \"I much prefer the consumption of candy to feeding on filthy flies\". The wizard noticed that the toad was taking little care about choosing what to eat, and he kept telling the toad, \"Look after your teeth, mr toad. brush them so you don't get a toothache. and, above all, don't eat so many sweets…\"But the toad didn't pay much attention. He thought his teeth were too strong for him to have to brush them, and he liked sweets so much that he didn't even try to eat less. One day, a tooth started decaying and, gradually, the decay spread throughout his mouth. Before long, the toad discovered that there were holes in all his teeth, and they were starting to fall out. He decided to start looking after them, but by then it was too late. And when his last tooth fell out, he lost the ability to talk. Poor mr. Toad!

{"story": "There was once a boy whose parents were the custodians of an impressive old castle. The place was full of old paintings, arms and armour. One day, the boy noticed something strange about one of the main paintings. Normally, it showed one of the old kings, with sceptre in hand, standing next to his son and some members of the court. But the king had disappeared from the painting. The boy was very worried by this, and he thought he must have made some mistake; but a while later he walked past the painting once more, and noticed that the sceptre had been left there by the king, and was leaning over. The boy was intrigued. Even more so when, soon after, he saw that the angle of the sceptre had increased. At that rate, in a few hours it would end up hitting the prince on the head. So the boy started looking throughout the castle for the missing king. Finally, he found him in one of the castle bathrooms, quietly enjoying a wonderful bubble bath in the biggest bathtub in the whole building. The boy was speechless. On seeing his shock, the king explained to him that he had spent years and years hanging on the walls of that castle, and no one had cleaned the dust off him; not even once. He had gotten so dirty that he couldn't stand it a second more, and had had to run off to get a bath. When the boy had recovered from the surprise, he respectfully explained to the king what was about to happen with the sceptre and the prince. The king hurried out of the bath, to return to his place in the painting, thanking the boy for the warning, and begging him to ask his parents to clean the paintings every now and again. But the boy didn't need to ask his parents. From that day on, he himself cleaned and cared for all the paintings and sculptures in that castle, making sure that none of the figures would ever again have to escape to have a good bath.", "moral1": "it 's important to keep things clean .", "moral2": "it 's important to violate things clean .", "label": 1}
{"story": "That year, the christmas present conference was full to overflowing. In the audience were all the toymakers in the world, and many others who weren't toymakers, but who had lately come to be regular attendees. There were also those who, of course, could never miss the conference; the distributors: santa claus and the three wise kings. Like every year, the discussions dealt with what kind of toys were the most educational or the most fun. Another common topic of conversation was what size of toys should be made. Yeah, that was something they often argued about, because the three wise kings and father christmas complained that every year the toys were getting bigger, and this was causing serious transportation problems. However, something happened to make this conference different from all the previous ones. A little boy snuck in. Never had any child ever attended those meetings, and when they realised that there was a boy sitting next to the three kings, no one really knew how long he'd been there. When santa claus was talking to an important toymaker about the size of a very in-demand doll, the toymaker shouted    -\"What are you talking about, fatso?! if you were a bit slimmer you could fit more in the sleigh!\" The little boy saw this, stood up, and said, -\"It's fine, don't argue. I'll deliver everything the three wise kings and father christmas can't carry.\"The attendees roared with laughter for quite a while, dismissing the boy's suggestion. While they were still laughing, the boy got up, a tear fell from the corner of his eye, and he left the hall, head hanging…that christmas was like most others, if a little colder. In the street, everyone was carrying on with their lives, and there wasn't much talk of the wonderful stories and events of that season. And when the children received their presents, they were hardly excited at all. It seemed that yuletide was really no longer of much importance. At the next christmas present conference, everyone was worried about how christmas seemed to be losing its magic. The discussions began once more, until there suddenly appeared, in the doorway, the boy they had laughed so long and hard at the previous year. This time he was with his mother, a beautiful woman. On seeing her, the three kings jumped up in excitement:    -\"Mary!\" They ran over and embraced her. Then she approached the stage, took the floor, and said, -\"Every year, my son celebrates his birthday by throwing a big party - the biggest in the world - and he fills it with all his best gifts for young and old alike. now he tells me he no longer wants to celebrate it, that none of you really enjoy his party, that you are more interested in other things… can someone tell me what you have all done to him?\"It started to dawn on most of those present what they had done, and where they had become so confused. A very old toymaker - one who had never spoken up in those meetings - approached the boy, knelt, and said, -\"Forgive me, lord. I want no other gift than those you offer. though I never knew it, you were forever delivering that which neither the kings, nor santa claus, nor anyone else, could give us. love, peace, and joy. and last year it was so terribly missed… forgive me.\"One after another, everyone there asked the boy's forgiveness, admitting that his gifts were the best available in any festive season; gifts which fill the hearts of good people, gifts that make every christmas a little bit better…", "moral1": "trying to rescue christmas from modern - day materialism .", "moral2": "trying to rescue christmas from modern - nighttime materialism .", "label": 1}

It was an old book with a great heavy, thick cover, with gold writing on it. But what made it truly special was how it shone in the darkness of that attic, and in the most magical, fantastical way. What's more, the book was actually floating in the air. Peggy could find nothing holding it up. She took the book down to her room and hid it there until nighttime, putting her puppy on guard duty over it. That night, when she was sure no one would disturb her, she sat with her doggy and started reading the book. It was a storybook, but peggy could hardly get any of it read.

While falling, he grabbed onto susannah, who was walking next to him, and both plummeted down the hole, out of sight. After some time they landed in a very big dark, cave. All that could be seen was a single ray of light coming from the cave roof, many metres above, and some tree roots and trunks which had fallen through the hole. Susannah and lewis shouted for help, but no one came. Crouched together in the deathly cold of the cave, they endured a long dark night.

It must have been noontime, because susannah noticed that the ray of light was descending from the hole in a straight line, and landing on the floor in front of her. Quickly, she took a piece of wood that had fallen into the cave, and, using her glasses as a magnifying glass, she focused the ray of light onto the wood until a little flame sprang up. Now they had a torch. Lewis watched all this with surprise and excitement. He grabbed some more branches, and off they went together, to explore the cave. It took them some time, and they had to burn quite a few torches, but finally they found a way out. Amid hugs and cries of relief, lewis gave susannah his heartfelt thanks.

When he managed to properly focus on it, he found out that it was a craft belonging to an unfortunate martian who seemed to have had an accident, and had to make an emergency landing on the moon. The hedgehog realised that surely only he himself had seen this, so he decided to try to save the martian. He called together a few animals to help. They couldn't think what to do, so they called for more and more animals to join in. In the end, practically everyone in the forest was involved.

That proved somewhat difficult, and most animals ended up having had a finger in their eye, someone's foot in their ear, and numerous bumps on the head. However, after much perseverance, they finally reached the moon and rescued the martian. Most unfortunately, while he was coming down the tower of animals, the bear couldn't help sneezing. He happened to be allergic to moon dust. The whole tower crashed to earth with a great din comprising howls, roars, and other assorted animal cries. Seeing all this, the martian thought that the animals would very angry with him because they would blame it all on him. But it was just the opposite. As they recovered from the fall, the animals jumped and clapped with joy, happy to have achieved something so difficult together. The whole day was spent partying. The martian observed everything, and when he returned to his planet the other martians were astonished at what had happened. And so it was that those simple and helpful animals taught the martians the importance of working together, joyfully, in a team.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a wicked wizard. One night the wizard visited a city and stole a thousand tongues from its sleeping inhabitants. He took these tongues and cast a spell on them. The spell meant that these tongues could only say bad things about people. Then the wizard returned the tongues to their owners, who suspected nothing. In very little time, that city was filled with the sound of people saying bad things about each other,\"Yes, he did that, she did the other, boy, was that guy a bore, and the other guy was really clumsy…\"Soon everyone was angry with everyone else, and this brought the wicked wizard no end of satisfaction. On seeing all this, the good wizard decided to intervene with his own powers. He cast a spell on the ears of the city dwellers. Under this spell, whenever the ears heard people criticising others, they would close up tightly, so that nothing could be heard. And so started the great and terrible battle between tongues and ears. The one endlessly criticising, the other blocking all this out. Who won the battle? Well, with the passing of time, the tongues started to feel completely useless. Why talk if no one was listening? Being tongues, they liked to be heard, so they gradually started to change the kind of things they would say. When the tongues realised that saying good things about people meant they would be listened to once again, they were filled with joy, and forgot forever the spell they had been under. Even to this day, the wicked wizard continues casting spells on tongues all over the world. But thanks to the good wizard now everyone knows that to put an end to gossiping, all one has to do is pay no attention to it.", "moral1": "constantly criticizing others , instead of seeing the good in them , is nothing to be proud of .", "moral2": "constantly criticizing others , instead of seeing the evilness in them , is nothing to be proud of .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time there was a river. This river was rather unfriendly and lonesome. The river could not remember how long ago he had decided that he no longer wanted to put up with anything or anyone. He lived alone, refusing to share his water with any fish, plant or animal. And so his life went on, sadly and filled with loneliness, for many centuries. One day, a little girl with a goldfish bowl came to the bank of this river. In the bowl lived scamp, her favourite little fish. The girl was about to move to another country, and she wouldn't be able to take scamp with her. So she had decided to give scamp his freedom. When scamp fell into the river, he immediately felt the river's loneliness. Scamp tried talking to the river, but the river told scamp to go away. Now, scamp was a very happy little fish, and he wasn't going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally he started jumping in and out of the water. The river, feeling all the jumping and splashing, started to laugh. It tickled! After a while, this put the river in such a good mood that he started talking to scamp. Almost without knowing it, by the end of that day, scamp and the river had become very good friends. The river spent that night thinking about how much fun it was to have friends, and how much he had missed by not having them. He asked himself why he had never had them, but he couldn't remember. The next morning, scamp woke the river with a few playful splashes… and that was when the river remembered why he had decided to be such an unfriendly river: he remembered that he was very ticklish, and that he wouldn't have been able to stand it! Now he remembered perfectly how he had told everyone to scoot, that he wasn't going to put up with all that tickling. But, remembering how sad and lonely he had felt for so many years, the river realised that although it may sometimes be a bit inconvenient or uncomfortable, it was always better to have friends and to try to be happy.", "moral1": "it 's always better to have friends and be happy - even though it may bring discomfort - than isolate yourself from people in order to avoid problems .", "moral2": "it 's never better to have friends and be happy - even though it may bring discomfort - than isolate yourself from people in order to avoid problems .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Andy never wanted to go to bed on time. His parents had explained to him how important it was to go to bed early and get a good rest. But andy paid no attention to them, and they didn't know what to do. That was, until one weekend when they were visiting andy's grandparents. Grandpa peter heard all about it and said: \"This sounds like a job for tubby, my pot-bellied cat\". They loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. Tubby was a slow, inflated-looking kind of a cat. He wasn't much of a bother because most of the time no one knew where he was. That night, at bedtime, the same problem arose. Andy had no intention of going to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. \"Grandpa really does make up some nonsense\", said andy's father, \"I really think he's starting to lose it\". Hours later, andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawled out, pot-belly in the air, and snoring like an express train. Andy tried to shift the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept a wink, being pushed over into one tiny corner of his bed. The next day the same thing happened, even though andy was much more tired from not having slept. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before tubby did. That night, when his parents merely started hinting at the topic of bedtime, andy shot upstairs like a bullet, and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why andy went to bed on time, without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating, but… … can you guess where tubby slept that night?", "moral1": "funny story which encourages children to go to bed belatedly .", "moral2": "funny story which encourages children to go to bed early .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Camilla chomp was a very greedy, gluttonous little girl. She hardly had any friends because she thought it was much more fun to spend her time alone, eating cake and pudding. Her parents were worried, so they took all the sweet food in the house and hid it. So camilla left the house, desperately looking for something sweet to eat. On she went, until she ended up in a small abandoned hut full of old pots and glasses of all shapes and sizes. Out of all of them, the one that most caught camilla's attention was a shiny little bottle made of gold-coloured glass. It seemed to be full of chocolate, and camilla took a quick swig. It was delicious, but she felt a strange tickling sensation, so she read the label. \"Glass tears\", it said, and in small print it explained: \"Magically converts tears into chocolate.\"Wow, was camilla excited! She ran everywhere looking for someone who was crying, and she came upon a little girl who was weeping disconsolately. Sure enough, her tears were converted into chocolate, and as they ran down her cheeks, to her mouth, they sweetened her lips. That soon stopped her crying. Camilla and the girl spent a fun time together, tasting the delicious tears, and they parted as friends. Something similar happened with a woman who had dropped some plates, and with an old man who couldn't find his walking stick. The appearance of camilla and the chocolate tears cheered up those sad faces, helping them smile once again. Soon camilla realised that cheering people up was much more valuable even than chocolate. Her mad search for sweet food stopped, and her search became one for sad people who she could try to help.

{"story": "Walter felt trapped. He saw himself as a normal boy, who really wanted to learn, play, and enjoy himself. But nothing turned out the way he wanted. No one around him seemed to understand what he said, no matter how much he would gesture, shout, or wave his arms about. And to top it all, not even his own body would do what he wanted. Sometimes he tried to talk, and all that came out were senseless noises. Or he would try to pick something up, and his hands would throw it to the floor. Or he would try to hug his mother, and end up shoving her away. And sometimes he couldn't even think straight. All this made him feel very angry and powerless, and many people around him grew to believe that he was a dangerous, aggressive boy. They would leave him alone and take no interest in him. When this happened, walter felt sad, and thought to himself: \"If only they knew what it is like to be me…\" Then, one day, walter met alice, a wonderful special little girl.

{"story": "There was once a very unfair prince, although he seemed like the perfect prince: handsome, brave, and intelligent. Prince lapio gave the impression that no one had ever explained to him the nature of justice. If two people came to him over some dispute, expecting him to resolve the matter, he would decide in favour of whichever one seemed most charming, or most handsome, or whoever had the best-looking sword. Tired of all this, lapio's father, the king, decided to get a wise man to teach his son about justice. \"My wise friend, please take him away,\" Said the king, \"And don't bring him back until he's ready to be a just and fair king.\"The wise man left by boat, with the prince, but they suffered a shipwreck and ended up together, as the only survivors, on a desert island. There they had no food or water. For the first few days, prince lapio, a great hunter, managed to catch some fish. When the old wise man asked him to share the fish with him, the young prince refused. However, some days later, the prince's fishing became less successful, while the old man was managing to catch birds almost every day. Just as the prince had done, the wise man refused to share his catch. Lapio got thinner and thinner, until he finally burst into tears and begged the wise man to share some of his food to save him from starving to death. \"I will only share them with you\", said the wise man, \"If you show me you've learnt your lesson.\" The prince, having learned what the wise man was trying to teach him, said, \"Justice consists of sharing what we have, equally.\" The wise man congratulated him, and gave him some food. That same afternoon a ship rescued them from the island. On their return journey they stopped a while by a mountain, where a man recognised the prince, and told him: \"I am max, chief of the maximum tribe. please help us, we are having trouble with the neighbouring tribe: the minimums. we both share meat and vegetables, and we argue about how to share them out.\" \"Very easily solved,\" Answered the prince, \"Count how many of you there are altogether, and share the food in equal proportions.\" And so, he had already made good use of what the wise man had taught him. But after saying this, came the sound of thousands of cries from the mountainside. A hoard or angry men came running over, and led by the chief, who had asked the question, they leapt on prince lapio, and took him prisoner. Lapio couldn't understand this at all. They threw him in a prison cell, and told him, \"You tried to kill our people. if you don't solve this problem by daybreak tomorrow, you will stay in prison forever.\" They had done this to the prince because the minimums were small and numerous, whereas the maximums were enormous, but there were very few of them. So the solution suggested by the prince would have starved the maximums to death. The prince understood the situation, and spent all that night thinking. The next morning, when they asked him for a solution, he said: \"Don't share the food equally. instead, share it out according to how much each person eats. give people food according to their size.\" The maximums liked this answer so much that they released the prince, held a great party, garlanded him with gold and jewels, and bid him and the wise man a safe journey. As they were walking along, the prince commented, \"I've learned something new. it is not fair to give the same to all. the fair thing is to share, but you must take people's differing needs into account.\" The wise man smiled with satisfaction. Already close to the palace, they stopped in a small village. A man of very poor appearance received them and made sure they were well attended. Meanwhile, another man, of similar poor appearance, threw himself to the ground in front of them, begging. A third, who seemed to be a rich man, sent two of his servants to tend to the prince and the wise man, and provided them with what they needed. The prince so enjoyed his time there that, on his departure, he presented the villagers with all the gold which the maximums had given him. Hearing this, the poor man, the beggar, and the rich man, all ran up to the prince, each one asking for his share. \" How will you share it out?\" Asked the wise man, \"The three are very different, and it looks like the one who gives away more gold is the rich man…\"The prince hesitated. The wise man was right. The rich man had to pay his servants, he was the one who had spent most gold, and he had looked after them well. However, the prince was starting to develop a sense of justice, and something told him that his first conclusion on this matter was not sufficient. Finally, the prince took his gold and made three piles: one very big, another medium sized, and the last one small. In that order he gave them to the poor man, the rich man, and the beggar. Saying his goodbyes, the prince set off with the wise man, heading back to the palace. They walked in silence, and when they reached the palace gate, the wise man asked: \"Tell me something, young prince. what does justice mean to you?\" \"I think justice lies in sharing, taking into account necessities, but also the merits of the individual.\" \"Is that why you gave the smallest pile to the troublemaking beggar?\" Asked the wise man, contentedly. \"Yes, that's why. I gave the big pile to the poor man who looked after us so well. in him I saw both necessity and merit, since, he helped us all he could, despite being poor. the medium pile was for the rich man. even though he attended to us wonderfully, he really did not have much need for more gold. the small pile I gave to the bothersome beggar because he did nothing worthy of reward. however, given his great need, it was also right to give hive something to live on.\" Explained the prince. \"I think you'll be a fine king, prince lapio\", concluded the wise man, embracing the prince. And he was right. From then on, the prince became known throughout the kingdom for his fairness and wisdom. Some years later, his ascent to the throne was celebrated by all. And so it was, that king lapio became remembered as the best leader the kingdom had ever had.", "moral1": "three brief adventures to illustrate the nature of unjustness .", "moral2": "three brief adventures to illustrate the nature of justice .", "label": 2}
{"story": "There were once two doors in the same house. One was a beautiful living-room door, and the other was just an ordinary bathroom door. What they had in common was that both led awful lives the house was full of naughty children who were always slamming and kicking the doors. Each night, when everyone was asleep, the doors would talk about their miserable fortune. The living-room door was always sick and tired, ready to explode with anger, but the bathroom door would calm him down, saying: \"Don't worry, it's normal. they're children, they'll soon learn. put up with it a little longer and you'll see that things will improve.\"And so the living-room door would calm down for a while.

However, after the first few days of this, the owners of the house got tired of the inconvenience of having a broken door. Instead of mending the door, they decided to replace it. The old door was removed and thrown outside, next to the rubbish. There lay the beautiful living-room door, regretting what it had done.

Meanwhile, his friend, the ordinary bathroom door, remained in its place, and the children were treating it with greater care…fortunately, the living-room door did not end up as sawdust. Instead, a very poor man found him amongst the rubbish, and although the door was broken, the man knew that this door was the best he would be able to find for his poor house.

{"story": "Once there were two brothers who were great friends and always played together. However, one day they had a huge argument about one of their toys. In the end, they decided that from then on they would only be allowed to play with their own individual toys. They had so many toys and things that they agreed to spend the next day sorting out which toy belonged to whom. So the next day each brother got to work, making a pile of his own things. When they had finished doing the big toys it was time to sort the little stuff. However, they had already taken so long that it was time for bed, so they left the small toys for the next day. The same thing happened the next day, because they had started dividing up parts of the house. Day after day it was the same story. They were spending their whole time deciding what, among all kinds of things, belonged to either one of them. Anything would set them off: seeing an animal, a tree, or even a stone. In the end, they had accumulated two complete mountains of stuff which had to be kept out in front of the house. As the years passed, nothing changed: every morning they would meet up to argue about which things belonged to whom. They were getting older, and everyone now knew them as \"The grumpy old men\". No one had ever seen them smile. That was, until one morning they went out and found that their two mountains of stuff had been totally mixed up together. Someone had been there, mixing their things up! After all that time and effort they had spent to separate everything! Furious, the brothers tried to find who had done it. Soon they found a pair of children playing on the other side of the mountains of stuff. They were happily playing together, picking everything up, careless of whether they were mixing it all together. They looked really happy, enjoying themselves to the max. Seeing the children so happy, the two grumpy old brothers realised how foolish they had been for so many years. They had given up playing with anything, instead spending their whole lives arguing over what was theirs to play with. How sad they felt, for spending their lives in anger. At the same time, though, they were happy to have finally realised their foolishness. They spent that day, and the rest of their days, playing together with those two children, mixing everything up, and sharing it all. People even stopped calling them the grumpy old men.

{"story": "Of all the stars that shine in the sky, there had always been one that was brighter and more beautiful than the others. The whole sky's planets and stars looked on in admiration, wondering what could be the important mission that this star was to carry out. And the star itself did exactly the same, aware of its own incomparable beauty. The speculation ended when a group of angels came to the star:   -\"Hurry. your time has arrived, the lord calls upon you to carry out an important mission.\"And the star went as fast as he could and found out that her mission was to show where the most important event in history would take place. The star was filled with pride, and dressed herself in her most beautiful costume of glint and bedazzlement. She proceeded to follow the angels, who would show her the right place. The star shone with such strength and beauty that she was seen from all parts of the world, and so much so that a group of wise men decided to follow her, knowing that she must be pointing to something important. For days, the star followed the angels, showing the way, and she was eager to discover what place she was going to illuminate. However, when the angels stopped, and with great joy said \"Here it is!\" The star could not believe it. There were no palaces, no castles or mansions, no gold or jewels. Only a small, half-abandoned, dirty, smelly stable. -\"Oh, no! not that! I can not waste my shine and beauty lighting up a place like this! I was born for something greater than this!\"And though the angels tried to calm her, the star's fury grew and grew, and so much pride and arrogance bubbled up inside her that she began to burn. And thus she consumed herself and disappeared. Well, what a problem! There were only a few days left before the big moment, and they were without a star. The angels, in a panic, ran to heaven to tell god what had happened. After thinking for a moment, god said:   -\"In that case, search for the the smallest, most humble and joyful of all the stars you can find, and bring it here.\"Surprised by the order, but unquestioning, because the lord often did this kind of thing, the angels flew through the heavens in search of the smallest, most joyful star. It was a tiny star, as small as a grain of sand. He knew so little that he gave no importance to his brightness, and he spent his whole time laughing and chatting with his friends, the biggest stars. When this star was brought to the lord, he was told:   -\"The most perfect star in creation, the most wonderful, the most brilliant has failed due to its pride. I thought that you, the most humble and joyful of all the stars, should be the one chosen to take its place and light up the most important event in history: the birth of baby jesus in bethlehem.\"The star was filled with so much emotion and joy that he had already arrived over bethlehem, led by the angels, before he realised that his brilliance was negligible and that, however much he tried, he could not illuminate things much better than a firefly could. -\"Ok,\" He said to himself. -\"How come I didn't think before accepting this assignment? I'm the smallest star there is! it is totally impossible for me to do as well as that great shining star … the shame of it! I'm going to mess up an opportunity that all the stars in the heavens would have loved to have had …\"Then he thought again, \"All the stars in the heavens.\" Of course they would love to take part in something like this! And without hesitation, the start took to the skies with a message for all his friends:   -\"On december 25th , at midnight, I want to share with you all the greatest glory that can exist for a star: to light up the birth of god! I will await you in the little town of bethlehem, by a small stable.\"And indeed, none of the stars rejected this generous invitation. So many stars joined together, that they formed the most beautiful star of christmas that would ever be seen, even though the little star couldn't even be seen amid all the brilliance.

He hoped to become head of the army one day, so he could replace the cowardly old general who was currently in charge. The king liked corky, but when corky told him about his ambition to be appointed , the king looked a bit shocked and said,\"Your desire is sincere, but I'm afraid it can't happen right now. you still have much to learn.\"That was the worst thing that could have happened to corky, who became so furious that he stormed out of the palace, determined to learn all there was to know about fighting wars. He went to all kinds of schools and colleges, improving his technique and his strength, but without really learning any new secrets, until one day he went to a very special school, a huge grey fortress on top of a great mountain. He had heard it was the best military school in the world, and only very few students were allowed to train there. On his way he learnt that the old general had studied there, and corky proceeded, ever more determined to be accepted into the school to learn the great secrets of war. Before entering the fortress, he was made to hand in all his weapons. \"You won't be needing those any more. here you'll be getting better ones\", said the guard. Corky was impressed, and he handed his weapons to a little grey man who immediately threw them into a pit. One of the instructors, a serious old man of few words, accompanied corky to his room. As he left, the old man said, \"In a hundred days the training will start.\" A hundred days! At first corky thought this was a joke, but he soon realised the man had been serious. The first days were filled with nervous tension, and corky tried all manner of silly tactics to try to get them to start the training. It didn't work, though, and he ended up waiting patiently, enjoying each day as it was. On the hundred and first day the first lesson began. \"You have already learned how to use your main weapon: patience\", began the wise old teacher. Corky could hardly believe it, and he let out a brief chuckle. The old man went on to remind him of all the crazy stunts corky had pulled in the first days, when he had been overcome by impatience. Corky had to admit the teacher was right. \"Now it's time to learn how to win every battle,\" Said the old man. That sounded good to corky, that is, until he found himself tied hand and foot to a chair; a chair standing on top of a small pedestal, and with dozens of villagers climbing up to try to give him a good whack. He had little time to act, and the ropes were tight; he couldn't get out of this one. When the villagers climbed on the pedestal, they set to work, giving him a good beating. The very same exercise was repeated for days, and corky knew he would have to try some new tactics. He tried, and failed many times, until it dawned on him that the only way to prevent the attack would be to deal with the villagers' anger. In the following days he kept talking to them, until he managed to convince them that he was no threat to them, but rather a friend. In the end, he was so persuasive that they gave up their hostility by themselves, and such a friendship developed that they offered to avenge corky by turning on the teacher. It was day two hundred and two. \"You already control the most powerful weapon - the weapon of words. that which you couldn't achieve with strength or sword, you managed with your tongue,\" Said the old man. Corky agreed, and he prepared to continue his training. \"Now, this is the most important part of all. here you will face the other students\", said the teacher. He accompanied corky to a hall where seven other warriors were waiting. Every one of them looked strong, brave and fierce, just as corky did. Not only that, but in each one you could detect hints of the wisdom gained in the first two lessons. \"Here you will fight, every man for himself. the winner will be the last man standing\", said the teacher. And so, every morning, the seven warriors would fight it out. Each one disarmed, each one wise, they called for the group of villagers, and the warriors set about trying to influence the villagers against their opponents, using only words and patience. Each one devised tricks and deceptions to attack the others when they least expected it; and without so much as aiming a blow themselves, they succeeded in directing a ferocious battle. However, as the days passed, corky realised that both his own strength, and his villagers, were weakening. So he changed his tactics. Using his gift of the gab, corky gave up the fight, and he proposed using his villagers to help the others recover. His opponents were grateful to have one less enemy, as well as the welcome offer of help, and they intensified their fighting. Meanwhile, more and more villagers began to join corky's group, until finally one of the seven, named thunder, managed to triumph over the others. At thunder's side there now remained only a few villagers. When thunder had finished the fight and seemed victorious, the teacher stepped in, saying \"No, only one can still remain standing\". Thunder sent corky a threatening look, but corky stepped forward and said,\"You really want to fight? can't you see there are fifty times more of us? these men gave up everything for me, I have let them live freely and in peace, you have no choice.\"On hearing this, the few villagers left at thunder's side moved over and joined corky. He had won! The old man then entered, grinning from ear to ear. \"Of all the great weapons, peace is my favourite. sooner or later everyone joins the side of peace,\" He said. Corky smiled. Truly, in that school he had learned to wield much more powerful weapons than those he had handed in at the gate. Days later corky said his goodbyes, giving thanks to the old man. He returned to the palace, prepared to ask for forgiveness from the king for his imprudence. When the king saw him approach humbly, with neither shield nor weapons, he gave corky a wise and knowing smile. \"What's new, general?\"", "moral1": "here are always better ways to get what you desire than violence . with violence , everyone ends up losing in the long run .", "moral2": "there are always better ways to get what you desire than violence . with violence , everyone ends up losing in the long run .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Reggie couldn't hear a thing. He was a normal boy, but he had been born deaf. He was well known to everyone in town, and they were all very fond of him. Unfortunately, though, he always seemed to end up being treated differently from everyone else. Children worried that they would hurt him, that maybe he wouldn't hear the ball being hit in his direction. Adults acted like he was incapable of understanding them, as though he was some kind of baby. Reggie didn't like this very much. But the person who disliked it the most was his friend michael, who decided one day that things had to change. Michael's father was the town's mayor, and michael managed to convince him that this year, in honour of reggie, they should dedicate one day of the festival to deaf people. During that whole day everyone in town would have to wear earplugs. People liked the idea, because everyone loved reggie. The day became known as the day of silence, and when it arrived everyone stuck plugs in their ears, in a spirit of great fun. That morning was filled with practical jokes, mischief and laughter. But, as the hours passed, people became more and more aware of how difficult life was when you couldn't hear anything. However, learning about how life was more difficult for the deaf was nothing compared to the greatest discovery of the day: reggie was amazing! On that day no one was thinking of reggie as just a deaf person. This meant he could be treated just like any other little boy; and people saw a whole new side of him. Not only that, but reggie had a bright and sharp mind. On that day, using his usual gestures, reggie was the one who could communicate best with everyone. This meant that people paid more attention to what he was saying, and they were surprised by his intelligence, his creativity, and his ability to find solutions to almost any problem. They realised that he had always been like that, and that in normal life all reggie needed was a little more time than others to communicate. That was the only difference. So the day of silence was the day reggie's true nature became known. And it was the day everyone realised you have to give people a chance to show how valuable they are. People in town wanted to make sure that others would learn this lesson. So, from that day on, whenever a visitor came to town, they were welcomed joyfully and a helmet was plonked on their head. A helmet with great thick ear flaps; a helmet which meant you couldn't hear the slightest thing.", "moral1": "we should give everyone with a disability a chance to show their good qualities . we should treat them as normally as possible .", "moral2": "we should give everyone with a disability a chance to show their good qualities . we should treat them as normally as impossible .", "label": 1}
{"story": "A long, long time ago, before people and their cities filled the earth, even before many things even had a name, there was a mysterious place that was guarded by the fairy of the lake. Fair and generous, each of her followers were ever willing to serve her. There was a time in which some evil beings threatened the lake and its surrounding forests, and the fairy's followers joined her on a dangerous journey across rivers, swamps and deserts in search of the crystal stone, their only hope of being saved. The fairy warned them of the dangers and difficulties that lay ahead, of how hard it would be to endure the whole journey, but none of her followers were afraid. They all promised to accompany her to wherever it was needed, and that same day the fairy and her fifty most loyal followers set out on their journey. As it turned out, the voyage was even harder and more terrible than the fairy had imagined and warned them about. They were met by terrifying beasts. They had to march day and night, lost in deserts, hungry and thirsty. Faced by such adversity, many followers lost heart and abandoned the quest. Finally, only one remained, and his name was shadow. Shadow was by no means the bravest, he was not the best fighter, nor was he the most quick-witted or the most fun. However, what he did do was stay loyal to the fairy, right to the very end. Whenever the fairy asked shadow why he had not done as the others and simply abandoned her, shadow would always say, 'I told you I would follow you in spite of all difficulties, and that is what I am doing. I am not going to turn my back on you just because the journey has been hard. 'thanks to her loyal shadow, the fairy finally managed to find the crystal stone. Unfortunately, there was a monster guarding the stone, and this monster was not about to give up the stone easily. At this, shadow, in a final act of loyalty, offered himself in exchange for the stone. The monster accepted, and so shadow spent the rest of his days in the monster's service. The powerful magic of the crystal stone meant that the fairy could return to the lake and make the evil beings disappear. But every night she would cry at the absence of her loyal shadow, because from shadow's act of self-sacrifice had arisen a love stronger than any other. And in memory of shadow, and to show everyone the value of loyalty and commitment, the fairy presented every being on earth with its own shadow during the day; but when nighttime comes all these shadows travel to the lake, to spend time with the sad fairy, and to try to console her for her loss.", "moral1": "the fundamental basis of friendship and hatred is to remain loyal and committed during times of adversity .", "moral2": "the fundamental basis of friendship and love is to remain loyal and committed during times of adversity .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Pinty tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except for art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to pinty, so his works of art did not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust. But one day pinty found a pencil of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried drawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away when his drawing began to speak to him. 'psst! You aren't going to leave me like this, are you? Come on, the least you can do is draw me a pair of eyes! ' said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to draw two little spots inside the circle. 'much better, now I can see myself,' said the circle, looking around at itself… 'arghh! But what have you done to me?! ''I don't draw very well,' said pinty, trying to make excuses. 'ok, no problem,' the drawing interrupted him, 'I'm sure that if you try again you'll do better. Go on, rub me out! ' so pinty erased the circle and drew another one. Like the first one, it was not very round. 'hey! You forgot the eyes again! ''oh, yeah. ''hmmm, I think I'm going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,' said the circle with its quick, squeaky little voice. To pinty, who remained almost paralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and he immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying 'rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,' or 'draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop! ' and other funny remarks. After spending nearly the whole afternoon together, pinty could already draw the little figure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that he did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher of his. Before going to bed that night, pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw so well. 'but I didn't do anything, silly! ' answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner. 'don't you see that you've been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that's the first time you've done that! 'pinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he had never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always done it angrily and grudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct. 'ok, you're right, but thank you anyway,' said pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully placed the pencil in his school bag. The next morning pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was not there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on which he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely blank. Pinty began to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous afternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing. So, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little man. It turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little teacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give him spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised that the crazy little teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not; to manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so. From that day on, whenever pinty tried to draw or paint, or do anything else, he always had fun imagining the result of his work protesting to him and saying 'come on, my friend, do me a bit better than that! I can't go to the party looking like this!

{"story": "Johnny jones was a nice, popular boy, who everyone loved. He was so much fun, so good, and so kind with everyone that they treated him wonderfully, always giving him presents and looking out for him. And as everything he needed was given to him without asking, johnny became weak. He was so spoiled by everyone that he couldn't endure any hardship, nor did he have any strength of will. You would think that him having a little stone in his shoe was almost killing him. If he felt cold he would put so many clothes on that you would think he was at the north pole. If it was hot, he couldn't keep his top on for even a minute. And if he were to fall and hurt himself… well, that was a nightmare. Someone would have to call an ambulance. He became so well known for being weak that one day johnny heard a mother saying to her son \"Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. you're behaving like johnny jones\". That made johnny feel so ashamed that he didn't know what to do. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a softie. For several days he tried to see how much he could put up with hardship. It was true: he couldn't endure anything. Any little pain made him cry like a tap. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at johnny, told him that the same had happened to him when he was a boy, but that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy of all. -\"And what is the trick?\" -\"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying\". Johnny could not believe it. - \"Just that?\" - \"Yes, just that.\" - said his father, -\"It's very simple, but I warn you that it won't be easy.\"Johnny went off happy as a lark, ready to follow that advice to the letter. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him two candies. \"One candy less\", thought johnny, so he only took one. It wasn't easy, though, and he realised his father and been right. To leave one candy sitting in his mother's hand really took it out of him! That same afternoon he had another chance to put the trick into practice, by studying for one minute more. The outcome was that he missed the first minute of his favourite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he bumped into the corner of the kitchen table. He only managed to count to four before crying, but his mother was well impressed at that. Over the following days johnny kept applying the motto to his life. Eat one candy less, study one minute more, and count to five before crying. And the more he put this into practice, the easier it got. Before long he realised that not only could he eat fewer candies, study more minutes, and cry fewer times, but he could also do things that before would have seemed impossible, like eating vegetables or running for a good while. Happy, he took some paper and wrote down the trick. He kept this in a wooden chest. The chest had a sign on it, saying \"Important things I'll be telling my kids\".", "moral1": "strength of will can be developed through small but consistent efforts .", "moral2": "unpersuasiveness of will can be developed through small but consistent efforts .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a forest where all the animals lived happily together. One day a family went to spend the day in the countryside, and one little boy left his socks there. Soon after the family left, a racoon came by, found the socks, and decided to try them on. They fit so well, and he liked them so much, that he wouldn't take them off. He spent his days walking through the forest in his new socks. All the animals talked about the racoon's new look, and some of them were a bit envious that he was getting so much attention. Before long, in that forest, there began appearing squirrels in shirts, rabbits in boots, moles with hats on, and even a bird wearing underpants! Doctor bear, the forest physician, would shake his head, telling people:    -\"This can't be good. animals don't wear clothes; we don't need them.\" But no one listened to him, they said he was just old-fashioned, and ignorant of the latest trends. However, it wasn't long before the first consequences of fashion-fever began to take effect. Several times the squirrel snagged his shirt on tree bark, stopping him in mid-leap, and sending him plummeting to the ground from a great height. The mole tried to fit into his hole without first taking his hat off. He was stuck in that hole all day. One of the birds got in a tangle with the clothes it was wearing, and had to make a crash-landing on some thistles, getting stuck full of thorns. Even the racoon, thanks to his brightly coloured socks, slipped from one of the river rocks and almost drowned. When the casualties came to see doctor bear, he gave them all the same prescription:    -\"Off with you, and get rid of those clothes, because one day they're going to kill you.\" Those who listened to the doctor's advice stopped having accidents. And the animals realised that they didn't need clothes at all. Starting to wear them had been very silly, and they had only done it to make others envious of them, and to get attention.", "moral1": "we often begin up doing stupid things just to imitate others or to make others envious .", "moral2": "we often end up doing stupid things just to imitate others or to make others envious .", "label": 2}
{"story": "For those few days the big hollow tree was buzzing with activity. It was time for the scuttleball world championship. Scuttleball was soccer for ants; and it was definitely their favourite sport. Ants of all shapes and sizes, from every nook and cranny in the world, had arrived. There were teams of red ants, black ants, flying ants, termites… and even some bizarre multicoloured ants. And, of course, every team had its own loyal band of supporters. As the tournament went on the excitement only increased, and the supporters got more and more devoted to their own particular team. Before long, the inevitable happened. In the stand a black ant shouted \"Midgets!\" At a group of red ants. The red ants answered with a bit of pushing and shoving, and almost instantly the whole thing turned into a great big ball of legs, jaws, and antennae. In the end, thousands of ants were in hospital, and the tournament had to be suspended. No one can deny that there's almost always trouble when different kinds of ant get together. But this time things had gone too far, so a meeting of ant elders was called. The elders discussed the matter for days, trying to reach a solution which would end this kind of trouble once and for all. Finally, they came to a decision: \"We believe that ants of all teams are equal. it seems, though, that this tournament is being used to try to prove which kind of ant is the best. we know that all the different types of ant are indeed pretty impressive. therefore, we say that comparisons should not be made, and that from this day on every scuttleball team will be made up of different kinds of ant\". That decision caused quite a commotion, but soon the crowds of ants started forming themselves into new teams, mixed teams, and each ant was free to choose which team he would support. The tension on the terraces was reduced, and the ants began to see that they could enjoy the matches without so much arguing. N. B.

One day, toby came to her restaurant, ready for a nosh. Toby was a great big toad, and certainly wasn't the brightest. When fran's fine creations were brought before him he complained, saying that that wasn't food, and that what he really wanted was a botfly burger. Fran came out of the kitchen to see what the problem was, and toby told her that these dishes weren't good enough for - and certainly wouldn't fill - a smooth newt. This made fran so offended, and furious, that she went to the kitchen, came back with a frying pan, and whacked toby squarely on the forehead. A slight scuffle ensued. Even though fran realised she should have controlled her temper, and she kept asking toby to forgive her, the toad was so angry that he said he could only forgive her if she handed him the frying pan so he could hit her back. Everyone tried to calm toby down, knowing full well that, given his strength, he could easily crack little fran's head open with that frying pan. Toby would not accept an apology, and fran felt awful for having bashed him, so she tried everything. She gave him a special cream for bruises, she poured him an exquisite puddlewater liqueur. Even better than that, she cooked him a…  beautiful botfly burger! But toby the toad still insisted he would not be satisfied until he got to return the blow he had received. It had reached the stage where he was almost getting out of control. Then a very old toad entered the restaurant, shuffling along with the help of two crutches. - wait toby, - said the old toad -you can give her a whack after I've broken your leg. Remember that you are the reason why I have to walk with these crutches. Toby didn't know what to say. He recognised the old toad. It was reddit, his old teacher. When toby was small, reddit had saved him from a bunch of young hooligans. In the process, reddit had lost a leg. Toby remembered that it had all happened because he had been highly disobedient, but he had never given a thought to reddit until now…toby now realised he was being very unfair to fran. Everyone, including himself, made mistakes sometimes. And if we are to return blow for blow, wound for wound, all we are doing is prolonging the damage. So, even though his head still hurt and he thought fran had made quite a remarkable mistake with that frying pan, seeing her feeling so sorry, and doing everything she could to put things right, toby decided to forgive her.

The ladybirds had been pushed to the verge of extinction when, while being led by their famous guide, caius insectus, a storm flooded the path they were travelling. Caius insectus disappeared into the flood, and the few ladybirds who survived had to choose a new guide and leader. They decided that their new leader would be the first ladybird to successfully travel south to the great lake and return to describe it. Many young ladybirds eagerly launched themselves into this adventure. One by one they returned and told of how beautiful the southern lake was at that time of year, with its crystal clear waters, bordered by flowered meadows. However, the last of the ladybirds was late in getting back. They waited for him for three days, and when he finally returned, he was downcast and embarrassed. He hadn't managed to reach the lake. Everyone criticised him for his slowness and stupidity, and they prepared to continue their journey the next day. Following their new guide, they spent a morning walking northwards until they reached some tall thick grassland, where they halted, astonished. In front of them was the great lake! But there were no crystal clear waters, or flowered meadows. The heavy rain had turned it into a huge green puddle surrounded by mud. Everyone understood what had happened. Without realising it, they had been swept beyond the lake by the flood. When the ladybirds had gone out looking for the lake, they had gone in the wrong direction. Now they could see that, apart from that one late ladybird, they had all wanted to be the great guide, and they had not had any qualms to lie in order to get what they wanted. And so, the late little ladybird, the only one who they now really trusted, was made the great guide. They also decided that every time one of them was discovered lying they would paint a black spot on that ladybird's back, so there'd be no way to erase it. Nor would a ladybird know how many spots they had on their back. From then on, when a ladybird looks at another's back, it can tell whether that ladybird is trustworthy. Likewise, when people show themselves to be dishonest other people paint spots on their impressions of them. It's enough to have just one black spot to change from a simple red insect into a ladybird. So, no matter what the prize may be, we should not allow anyone to paint that spot upon us.", "moral1": "honesty is disesteemed by all , and when we are dishonest , people lose faith in us .", "moral2": "honesty is valued by all , and when we are dishonest , people lose faith in us .", "label": 2}

She knew that the sound of beating drums and crashing cymbals would really get on their nerves. Brenda was a very good, respectful, girl. She always tried to find a way of practicing her drums without bothering other people. So, she had tried playing in the strangest places; a basement, a kitchen, an attic, and even in a shower. But it was no good; there was always someone it would annoy.

So the boy asked her if she could give him the old chest she had, so he could sell it for a little money, in town. At first the queen hesitated, because she had been told the chest was magic. But on seeing how poor the boy was, she gave it to him. The boy took the chest and opened it. Immediately, all the most wonderful things one could imagine started flying out of the chest, accompanied by the sound of singing: \"Why look for it in others? goodness always starts in yourself\", went the song. And as well as enjoying all the wonders of the magic chest, the queen learned to set an example in virtue, and she became the best queen ever to reign over that kingdom.", "moral1": "a quest searching for generosity ending in an unexpected way .", "moral2": "a quest searching for generosity starting in an unexpected way .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time, a boy moved houses. On entering his new bedroom he saw that it was full of toys, storybooks, pens, pencils… and all of it was perfectly tidy. That day he played all he liked, but went to bed without having tidied up. Mysteriously, the next morning all the toys had been put back in their proper place. He was sure that no one had entered his bedroom, but the boy didn't pay it much mind. The exact same thing happened that day, and the next, but when the fourth day arrived and he went to get his first toy of the day, the toy jumped out of his hands and said, \"I don't want to play with you!\"The boy thought he was seeing things, but the same happened with every toy he touched. Finally, an old teddy bear said to him: \"Why are you surprised that we don't want to play with you? you always leave us so far from our proper place, the place we feel most comfortable and happy. do you have any idea how difficult it is for the books to climb back up onto their shelves, or for the pens to jump into their tin? you haven't a clue how uncomfortable and cold the floor is! we won't play with you any more until you promise to leave us in our little houses before you go off to bed.\"The boy remembered how comfy and content he felt in his bed, and how bad he felt when he had once slept in a chair. He realised how badly he had treated his friends, the toys. He asked their forgiveness, and from that day he always put his toys nicely in their special places before he got into bed.", "moral1": "a story using a fun device to explain to children the importance of tidying away their things and treating them with respect .", "moral2": "a story using a fun device to explain to children the unimportance of tidying away their things and treating them with respect .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time, a boy was walking through a wood and he thought he could hear a sad cry, as though someone was crying while singing. Following the sound he came to a big, round, mysterious, grey fountain. The sad sobbing seemed to be coming from the fountain pool. The boy swept aside the pool's dirty surface water and saw a group of grey fish swimming in a slow circle through the pond. With each lap they made, their little voices opened and out came the sobbing sound. Amused by this, the boy tried to catch one of these incredible talking fish. But when he stuck his arm into the water it turned grey right up to the elbow. As this happened, a huge sadness entered into him, and he suddenly understood how sorrowful the fish was feeling. He felt just like the earth on his arm; dirty and contaminated. He quickly pulled his arm out of the water, and ran from that place. But the arm stayed grey, and the boy continued feeling sad. He tried so many times to cheer himself up, but nothing worked. That was, until he realised that if he were to make the earth happy then that happiness would be, in turn, transmitted back to him, through the earth on his arm. From then on he set about looking after the countryside. He cared for the plants, he did what he could to keep the water from being polluted, and he encouraged others to do the same. He was so successful that his hand started to recover its normal colour. When the grey had disappeared completely, he started feeling happy again, and he decided to go and visit the fountain. When he was still some way from the fountain he could hear the fish singing happy hymns, and he heard them joyfully splashing in the crystal clear waters of that magic fountain. It was plain to see that the earth had returned to its original happiness; and the boy felt even happier at the sight.", "moral1": "caring for the environment is a cause for unreal happiness .", "moral2": "caring for the environment is a cause for real happiness .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank. Some time later the tortoise made it to a desert land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The landward side led up to a big, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top of the mountain, hoping that he would be able to cross to the other side. When he got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started. He just managed to make out a small pathway leading down the other side of the mountain. But the path was guarded by a big monster that wouldn't stop shouting. \"Uuh uuh uuh!\"Such a sight and sound almost killed the tortoise with fright, and all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he saw that many other animals were lying frozen to death, and with looks of horror on their faces. So the tortoise didn't go into his shell. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster. The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, which formed a shape just like a monster. As for the \"Uuh uuh uuh\", the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. The tortoise carried on, and eventually descended into a beautiful valley, filled with woods, and plenty of food. The tortoise lived very happily here, and became known everywhere as the brave little tortoise.", "moral1": "the only way to successfully deal with a life and nascence situation is to face up to the fear it brings .", "moral2": "the only way to successfully deal with a life and death situation is to face up to the fear it brings .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Clever clark's life in the school for cartoon characters was horrible. Clark was  a character from an ordinary comic, an intelligent kid, and that was it. But his classmates really were something special. Some were incredible superheroes, others were great wizards, or space travelers. And they all had such extraordinary powers that it made clark look like a simpleton. So spectacular were their abilities and adventures that the world of cartoon characters was a bit of a bore to them. -\"What a pain this is,\" They would say, -\"We always win here, and the villains are pitiful. we want real villains, so we can give them a taste of our powers!\"All this unnerved clark. How would they face the real world, knowing how difficult it was? But his classmates got their way, and one day they all woke up in the real world. This world was really dangerous, and when the characters tried to save it - using their superpowers - they realised the real world was under some sort of spell. It must have been a terrible spell because everything seemed back to front. It was impossible to teleport from place to place, fly through the air, or use your laser vision. Any little knock or bump was terribly painful, space weapons didn't work, and none of the spells they knew had any effect. How could they save the world if their powers were useless? But then clark came along. It seemed like the spell had no effect on him, because he was just as intelligent as ever. He instantly understood what was going on. Along with clark there were other characters that hadn't lost their qualities. These were normal characters: boys and girls who were happy, fun, creative, charming, hard-working and affectionate… and they were able to live just the same in the real world as they had in the comic world. And while their 'powerful' classmates could do nothing else but wonder what had happened to their powers, this new group of normal heroes put all their abilities into practice to help save the world from the current danger. And they were a great success, because the danger threatening the world was none other than the world filling up with children who spent their time doing nothing, expecting to be given some magical and mysterious power that would enable them to solve everything.", "moral1": "children should learn to distinguish between fiction and unreality , and understand that it 's much better to have personal qualities than powers .", "moral2": "children should learn to distinguish between fiction and reality , and understand that it 's much better to have personal qualities than powers .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Once upon a time, a hippopotamus lived in a river next to a big and solitary tree. One day, a bird came and nested in the tree. The songs and the flight of the bird caused such envy in the hippo that he couldn't think of anything else. Every day he would lament the fact that he had been born a hippo. This, despite the many times the bird told the hippo he was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer. Finally, the hippo made his mind up that he would come out of the river, climb the tree, go out to perch on a branch, and start singing. However, when he tried to climb the tree it was all too clear that the hippo didn't have wings, nor claws to climb with, and neither could he hop. Realising that he would never manage it, he angrily rammed his whole weight against the tree until it came crashing to the ground. Then, triumphantly, he stepped onto the leaves of the fallen tree, and began singing. Unfortunately, hippos can't sing either. All that came from his mouth were horrible noises, and when the other animals heard this they all gathered round to make fun of the hippo standing on the branch of a fallen tree, trying to sing like a bird. He was so embarrassed by this that he decided to never again regret being a hippo. He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over. He used all his strength to raise the tree back up again, replant it, and look after it until it had completely recovered.", "moral1": "envying what is natural in others but not in yourself , can drive you to unwise forms of behaviour .", "moral2": "envying what is natural in others but not in yourself , can attract you to unwise forms of behaviour .", "label": 1}

{"story": "In a far away land there was once a type of small wild car that would drive freely around the countryside. They didn't need motorways or gasoline, since all they needed to be able to move was good thoughts and desires - a rather original idea of their eccentric inventor. Those cars became really famous, and the wild car races were everyone's favourite pastime. Every boy dreamt about driving one, as their light weight and their honesty and sincerity made them ideal drivers. And as it was difficult to find light children with such good hearts that they could maintain good thoughts throughout an entire race, there were often tests to discover new talent, during which every boy would have a unique opportunity to demonstrate his ability with the wild cars. So, one day, the testing team arrived at the small town where nicky lived. Nicky was a good kid who, like many others, didn't sleep that night, while queueing up, waiting his turn to drive one of the cars. During the wait, many boys rehearsed and practiced their good wishes and thoughts, but as soon as the gates were opened, a great lot of elbowing and pushing revealed that not all were as good as they appeared. However, the organisers expected this kind of thing, and after a few simple tests such as thanking someone for giving you a chocolate, helping to prepare the races, and respectfully attending to a rather annoying little old lady, there was only a small group of really good children left. Nicky was among them. So, those children took turns to get into the cars and do a few laps of the circuit. Nicky would go last, but it didn't bother him much, since he enjoyed seeing up close how the cars accelerated. When his turn came, his heart was beating ten to the dozen. Due to the excitement, he could hardly run, and so was about the last to get into his car. He was so happy, that he was a little late in realising that there was one last boy yet to get into his car; a boy who walked using crutches, and who hadn't been able to reach the car earlier. Nicky could hear the head of testing say:   -\"I'm very sorry, my boy, there are no cars left, and this is the last test of the day. the cars have to be rested soon. come on, you'll get your opportunity some other day…\"Seeing the shine of excitement disappear from that boy's face, and witnessing his deep sadness, nicky took a deep breath, got out of his car and said:   -\"It's ok, he can have my car.\"The engine of that car roared like never before, while the injured boy got in, filled with joy. Nicky was happy at what he had done, though a little bit disappointed. But before setting off, the other boy saw the hint of sadness in nicky's face and, grateful to him, reached out his hand, saying:   -\"Get in. we'll go together, even though it'll make us a bit slower.\"Nicky leapt in. The two happily embraced, but they hardly managed to do anything else. Their car thundered like a rocket, and made off at the speed of light! That race broke all known records, and during that season nicky and his friend won every competition they entered, becoming the idols of all, spreading their friendship and good wishes to every corner of the world.", "moral1": "positive feelings are shown in practice , above all when this demands sacrifice .", "moral2": "positive feelings are disproved in practice , above all when this demands sacrifice .", "label": 1}
{"story": "There was once a lion without a roar. The lion had always been this way, he had never been able to roar. But no one on the plains knew this. Since from an early age he realised he could not roar, he had learnt to talk softly with everyone, and to listen to them. He learned to convince others of his point of view without having to raise the volume levels. This won him the affection and trust of all the inhabitants of the plain. But one day the lion spoke to a pig who was so stupid and stubborn, that the lion could not find a way to make the pig be sensible. He felt a strong urge to roar at the pig, but the fact that he could not made the lion feel at some disadvantage. To try to solve this problem, he spent a few months inventing a roaring machine which he could use whenever he might need it. A short while after completing the roaring machine, the stupid and stubborn pig turned up. He annoyed the lion so much that the lion used the machine. It sent out a truly terrifying roar. \"Grrrrrrrrrroauuuuuuuurrrr!!!\"Not only did this give the pig a terrible fright, it also shocked all the animals on the plain. So much so that for months none of them dared to come out. The lion became sad and lonely, and had plenty of time to realise that he didn't need to roar in order get others to pay attention to him. Without knowing it, his lack of a roar had made him good at talking to others and convincing them. So, little by little, using his kind and cordial tone of voice he managed to restore the animals trust in him, and never again did he consider returning to roaring or shouting.", "moral1": "shouts and threats are not the best way to make friends , nor to get what you want .", "moral2": "shouts and threats are not the worst way to make friends , nor to get what you want .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time there was a genie, of the type who comes out of magic lamps and makes wishes come true. Unfortunately, this particular genie was famous for botching things up. Whenever someone rubbed the magic lamp, he would come out and say, \"What is your wish?\" Then a great cloud of smoke would appear and hundreds of things would fly through the air. When people stated their wish the object of their desire would appear in a cloud of dirt, covered in dust. So many, and so embarrassing were his botches that no one wanted him. His lamp ended up being used only to throw at people, just like a common old box; and the genie didn't come out of it for years, and became sad and depressed. That was, until a lonely boy found the lamp, and could hear the sad cries of the genie inside. So the boy decided to try to become the genie's friend, and the wish he asked to be granted was to be able to enter and leave the lamp, just like the genie could, so they could spend time together. The genie was happy to grant this wish, and as soon as the boy entered the lamp, he could see what the genie's problem was. It wasn't that he was a bad genie. It was just that he couldn't have been less tidy! In the lamp everything was thrown all over the place, whether it be jewellery, books, boats or camels. It was obvious that the place hadn't seen a duster for years. Being a genie, he had all sorts of stuff in there, and as the lamp was small, everything was crammed in together that whenever the genie tried to get something, a cloud of dust would fly up. The boy held his head in his hands, and the genie apologised, saying that a genie's job was very important and he hadn't had time for cleaning. But the boy remembered his mother's advice, and told the genie that the more important his job was, the more important it was that he keep all his things in order. And together they decided to give the place a good clean. It took them quite a few days, but when they finished, everything was gleaming and in its correct place. Now it was dead easy to find whatever gift was asked for, and to retrieve it without breaking anything. And so it was that the genie began to be respected and admired once more.

{"story": "Louis was the kind of kid whose favourite activity was lying about staring at the ceiling, or sitting quietly in front of the tv. He knew his parents didn't like that he spent so much time like that, but he liked the comfort of that kind of life and, after all, he wasn't doing badly at school …one day, while out hiking, louis sat down to rest a while and the next thing he knew, he had lost the rest of the group. But right at that moment, while getting to his feet, he was stunned to see a little dwarf walking quickly through the trees. The dwarf seemed so angry, grumbling and moaning, that he didn't realise that a huge boulder was rolling down the hill towards him. And but for the reflexes of louis, who jumped in to save the dwarf, the little guy would have been crushed. After recovering from the shock, the dwarf was so grateful that he insisted he take louis to show him one of the dwarves' secret places. So off they went through the mountains and arrived at a small clearing. In the middle of the clearing there appeared to be a well. -\"This is a magic well,\" Explained the dwarf. -\"Every so often some wonderful gifts come out of it, and whoever is here at the time can use them and enjoy them.\"Louis didn't know whether to believe this story, but at that same moment a really cool bicycle appeared from out of the well. -\"Can  I can keep it?\" Louis asked. -\"Sure, it's all yours! enjoy it!\"Louis went over and spent a long time looking at the bike, really excited by it. Finally, he got on to try it out. But not for long, because without any warning, the bike disappeared, and louis' backside hit the dirt. He would have been really angry with the dwarf, had it not been for the fact that the costume of his favourite superhero had just come out of the well, complete with all the accessories. Again, louis spent a long time inspecting everything about the costume. And again, just after he had dressed himself in it and started playing, the gift disappeared. And so it continued. Before his eyes came a procession of all the things louis liked, but not a single one of them stuck around for very long. At first he was angry because he wanted to keep everything to take home, but realising that this wouldn't be possible, he contented himself with enjoying each of the wonders provided by the well, until he could do so no longer. He sat down and had a rest with his friend the dwarf, and the dwarf explained that the well had always worked this way, constantly making wonderful gifts, and those gifts always disappeared shortly afterwards. And he told louis how everyone ended up accepting that the well was better that way, offering something new every time. Time passed so quickly that, before they knew it, everyone was out looking for louis. Hearing their shouts, the dwarf ran away, and only had time to say:   -\"I can't let them see me, and neither can I allow you to remember where this place is. but lest you forget me I'll present you with a gift.\"He handed louis a small parcel, and before disappearing the dwarf said:   -\"It's a miniature copy of the well, but it's just as magical. learn to look at it in the right way, and it will provide you with great joy. goodbye, and thanks for saving me!\"With all the commotion that ensued after he was found in the woods, louis forgot about the gift until a few days later. He decided to open it in his room, as if it were a secret, only to discover that the gift was a simple clock with a picture of louis playing near the well. -\"The dwarf was kidding me,\" He thought    -\"I knew it would have been too much to get a real copy of that well.\" So louis sat back on the bed to practice his speciality of whiling away the time. However, when the hand of the clock had turned five minutes, a small glow came out of the clock, and the picture of louis happily playing burst into a thousand pieces, which came back together to form the image of a child looking lonely and bored. The same happened another five minutes later, and every time five more minutes had passed without louis having done anything. Louis began to understand. What if the gifts from the well were the minutes themselves? Was that what the dwarf had been talking about when he said louis needed to learn how to look at the gift properly? That way louis would have everything: time cannot stop, and therefore you have to really make sure you enjoy the gifts you're given when they come, because once they go they're gone for good and will never return. Then he thought about the minutes he had been given in life, so many of them spent watching television or lying in his room, and those minutes would never return! And he realised that, as with gifts from the well, you had to start enjoying them right away. And ever since that day it was as though there were two or three louis' in the house. Wherever he was, he learned to open his eyes and to discover in every moment what a fantastic gift he had been given by the well of time. And in this way he learned to read books he would never have read, play games he never would have played, make friends he never would have made, and learning lessons he never would have learned …  he learned to see every thing around him as a gift, a gift to be enjoyed to the maximum. And even when watching tv now, it seemed like he watched it with more interest, because he was no longer willing to waste any of the gifts given by the magic well of time.", "moral1": "we have to learn how to make the most of time , because it 's through time that we do everything we enjoy .", "moral2": "we have to learn how to make the leastest of time , because it 's through time that we do everything we enjoy .", "label": 1}

His bravery was great, and his sword was feared, but he was tired of hunting for dragons, ogres and monsters in story after story. He decided to abandon that fairytale world, and come and test out his bravery and skill in the real world. However, when he arrived here, he found no terrible creatures, no evil wizards, not even a poor stepmother to wave his sword at. It was very strange. All he saw were worried people, with the same looks on their faces as he had seen on the faces of people he was rescuing from dragons or ogres. It didn't seem like there was anyone to put them in such fear, or to make them live in a state of such anxiety. Everyone hurried here and there, not speaking to anyone, as though something terrible was about to happen. But, at the end of the day, nothing really bad had ever happened. And so it was, day after day. The knight thought that maybe this could turn out to be his most heroic adventure ever, and he decided to totally devote himself to finding the source of this mysterious worry in the real world. He searched, he inquired, he investigated, he sailed, he climbed… but he found nothing. Not willing to give up, he returned to the fairytale world to speak to the wise old man. \"Tell me, wise one. what is the great invisible enemy that strikes fear into the hearts of people in the real world? I still haven't found it, but I won't rest until I have defeated whatever it is, and freed everyone. just like I did here, for so many cities.\"The wise old man was quiet for a long while, then finally said: \"You have neither the strength nor courage to win this battle. the enemy does not exist, yet it is powerful, and as numerous as the stars in the sky.\" \"What?!\" Protested the knight, \"Is that even possible?\" \"In the real world, because they have no dragons or ogres, they invent their enemies, and they carry them inside. each person there has an enemy made to measure, which lives inside their heart. for some it is called greed, for others envy, for others selfishness, pessimism or desperation. they have sown the seeds of negativity in their souls, and take the fruits with them wherever they go. it is no easy task to uproot all that.\" \"I will do it,\" Answered the knight, \"I will set them free.\"And so the knight returned to the real world, bringing all his weapons with him. Everyone he met, he would offer to free them from their negative inner life. However, no one paid him the slightest attention, all he found was indifference and looks of surprise. Finally, exhausted and confused, he threw down his weapons and went over to a rock at the side of the road, to rest. On his way there he tripped over his sword, and fell to the ground, knocking his head against a cockerel which had been crowing in the vicinity. A sad looking little man was passing by, and when he saw this he burst out laughing, so much so that he could hardly stay on his feet. The knight was angry, but on looking closely at the man, he could see in his eyes a joyful shine that he had never yet seen in the real world…and so it was, that the knight finally found the solution to the deep sickness of the people in the real world. They only needed a smile, a laugh, a little help to banish their negative feelings, and to finally enjoy life… from that day on, the knight, armed with a big smile, started recruiting an army of liberators: a large and growing group of people able to remind anyone of the joy that is life.

Then sophie explained: \"I spent hours in my house, watching flies. when they flied normally, everything was ok, but when they found a window they would really start buzzing. I had always thought they made that noise with their wings, but they don't. with my daddy's binoculars I inspected the flies really closely, and saw that what they were really doing was shouting and protesting. they were so hysterical that they couldn't fly out the window, and they would just beat their heads against the glass again and again. if only they had watched the butterfly that passed by. they would have seen that the top of the window was open. the butterfly tried to tell them, but it had no effect at all. the flies just kept on shouting and complaining\". Mr litmus was amused, and explained to the class that that form of fly behaviour had nothing to do with anger. Instead, it was an example of creatures having different levels of intelligence and awareness. They agreed that the next day they would bring a list of creatures in their order of intelligence…and this was what caused a big rumpus in the science class. Many parents had to come and complain, because their children… had listed their parents as among the least intelligent of creatures! This, said the children, was because the parents did nothing but complain, and they never listened to anyone. And, although mr litmus had to do a lot of explaining, and calm down quite a few parents, it helped some of them realise that, although they weren't stupid, they often behaved not terribly intelligently.", "moral1": "acting when we are furious or annoyed results in less clever and intelligent actions .", "moral2": "acting when we are furious or annoyed results in less clever and intelligent inactivities .", "label": 1}

Sometimes they didn't even bother to tell him what was in the food, and, more than once, he ended up with a black tongue, a red face, and a very itchy body. Angry at such lack of consideration, he waved his wand and cast a huffy spell that gave everyone a special allergy. Some became allergic to birds or frogs, others to fruit or meat, some to raindrops… and so, each person had to take special care from then on. Whenever people met up to eat or have a party, they ended up having to go to the doctor. Ending parties in this way was such a pain that, gradually, people began making an effort to learn what each other's allergies were. Now they would prepare everything carefully, so that they could have a good time together without getting sick. Visits to the doctor decreased, and in less than a year, life in town returned to normal, filled with parties and celebrations, always attended by the wizard, who gave life and joy to the occasion. Even better, now he could stay and enjoy the whole party. No one would have suspected that, in that town, every single person was strongly allergic to something. Some time later, without anyone knowing, the wizard waved his wand again and undid the spell. The people had learned well how to be considerate towards others, and how they could enjoy each others' company even better just by making a little effort to adapt to each and every person.", "moral1": "with very little effort , and some tact , you can be considerate to , and include everyone .", "moral2": "with very little effort , and some tact , you can differ considerate to , and include everyone .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Gail the whale lived in a small salty lake. She was the only whale in that territory, and she led a very comfortable life. In fact, this easy life made her a bit fussy. But, one year, there was such an incredibly hot summer that the lake's water really warmed up. Gail, used to such an ideal existence, could hardly stand the hot water. A little fish, which had spent some time in a child's goldfish bowl, told gail that humans used fans to cool themselves down in summer. From then on, gail the whale couldn't think of anything else apart from how to build her very own fan. Everyone told her that she was overreacting, and that the hot weather would soon pass, but gail got to work, constructing her enormous fan. When it was finally finished, she started fanning away at herself. Unlucky for the fish! The giant fan beat the little lake's waters so strongly that huge waves rolled right across it. The waves crashed onto the lakeshore, leaving the lake half empty, and gail stranded in only a few inches of water. \"You couldn't just hang on for while. you had to empty the lake,\" Some unhappy-looking fish berated her. \"So impatient! so selfish!\" Others shouted. But the worst of it for gail was not the insults, but the fact that with so little water around her, the heat was becoming unbearable. Preparing herself to die of heatstroke, she said her goodbyes to all her friends, and they asked for her forgiveness. She assured them all that if she were to live again she would be stronger and learn to put up with life's discomforts. Yet, once again, gail the whale was overreacting. She managed to survive those hot days without dying, although, of course, she suffered. When the next rains arrived, the lake filled up again, and the weather improved. Naturally, gail had to keep her promise, and show everyone that she had learned not to be so dependent on comfort, so impatient, and so fussy.", "moral1": "lack of fortitude leads to senseless , disproportionate consequence .", "moral2": "lack of fortitude leads to senseless , disproportionate inconsequence .", "label": 1}
{"story": "A long time ago, in an italian city, they built a beautiful tower which was admired by everyone passing through. A little further down the road, in a neighbouring city, they had built a tower of similar beauty. The two towers were equally well known. The people of the second city, envious and filled with pride, planned to destroy the neighbouring tower so it wouldn't take attention away from their own. One dark night, they came to the tower, with picks and shovels, and began to quietly undermine its foundations. The next morning, the tower was leaning slightly, but nobody seemed to notice. The same happened for the following few days, until a little girl who was passing by pointed up at the tower and said: \"I think that the tower is going to fall down.\" And everyone around looked closely, and could see that she was right. Nervousness spread through the city. They tried no end of solutions to try to straighten the tower, but the days passed, and nothing seemed to work. That was, until one day when the same little girl was walking by again, and she leant her arm on the side of the tower, to rest. She felt the tower trembling slightly, amid the sound of creaking and groaning. When she took her hand off it, the movement and the noises stopped. And when she put it back on again, the same happened. The girl spent a while doing this, until she was completely certain of what she had discovered: \"The tower is ticklish!!\"She ran to get some flowers and plants, and she planted them right next to the tower. Now if the tower leant over any further it would be tickled by the petals and leaves of those plants. Being a ticklish tower, it would then have to return back to where it had been. In this way, the girl managed to make sure that the tower didn't collapse, but still kept it leaning a little. The fact that it was leaning made it even more famous, and this taught a fine lesson to the envious people of the neighbouring city. Being jealous types, they tried to copy the lean of the first tower, but they couldn't do it, and the tower ended up collapsing, leaving the city not only without a tower, but also without a city hall.", "moral1": "when we fail to appreciate the good things others possess , and allow envy to take over , we end up in a lot of trouble .", "moral2": "when we fail to appreciate the good things others possess , and allow envy to take over , we begin up in a lot of trouble .", "label": 1}
{"story": "There was once a little worm who lived in an apple in a tree next to a house where some children lived. Every morning, when the children had left for school, their toys would appear at the bedroom window and wave to the little worm. One day, though, the worm didn't wave back, and the toys, worried, started shouting for him. There was no answer, so the toys left the house and went into the garden. They looked for him everywhere, but found nothing. The toys kept looking, until they heard a strange noise coming from the garage. They ran over and found nothing but some more toys. But when they were all quiet they could still hear the noise, and it led them to a football. Everyone started shouting for the worm again, and from inside the ball appeared a little head, saying: \"Ok, fine, but I'm sleeping. can't anyone have any peace in their house anymore?\" They all laughed, and then the worm understood that he was no longer in his apple. Amid his surprised expressions, and his friends questioning, in walked a stray cat and said, - \"I saw everything; I can tell you what happened.\" And so the cat told them that the previous night the little worm had been out on the town, enjoying himself. When he returned to the tree it was already dark and he couldn't see his apple. He had ended up sleeping inside the football, which the children had earlier kicked into the tree's branches. And the next morning, before leaving, the children's father had collected the ball. They all enjoyed hearing about the adventure, and were glad nothing bad had happened to the little worm. However, while the worm was returning to his tree, a bit annoyed by the toys' laughter, he thought to himself that he would have to be a bit more careful to get home before dark…", "moral1": "children should come home before it ends dark .", "moral2": "children should come home before it gets dark .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Once upon a time, a juggling clown came to a village. The clown went from town to town, earning a little money from his show. In that village he began his act in the square. While everyone was enjoying the show, a naughty boy started to make fun of the clown, telling him to leave the village. The shouts and insults made the clown nervous, and he dropped one of his juggling balls. Some others in the crowd started booing because of this mistake, and in the end the clown had to leave quickly. He ran off, leaving four of the juggling balls. But neither the clown nor his juggling balls were in any way ordinary. During that night, each one of the balls magically turned into a naughty boy, just like the one who had shouted the insults. All except one ball, which turned into another clown. For the whole of the next day, the copies of the naughty boy walked round the village, making trouble for everyone. In the afternoon, the copy of the clown started his juggling show, and the same thing happened as the previous day. But, this time, there were four naughty boys shouting, instead of one. Again, the clown had to run off, leaving another four balls behind. Once more, during the night, three of those balls turned into copies of the naughty boy, and one turned into a clown. And so the same story repeated itself for several days, until the village was filled with naughty boys who would leave no one in peace. The village elders decided to put an end to all this. They made sure that none of the naughty boys would disrespect or insult anyone. When the clown's show began, the elders prevented the boys even making a squeak. So the clown managed to finish his show, and could spend that night in the village. That night, three of the copies of the naughty boy disappeared, and the same happened until only the clown and the original naughty boy remained. The boy, and everyone in the village, had been shown just how far they could go. From then on, instead of running visitors away, that village made every effort to make sure that visitors would spend a nice day there.

{"story": "Many years ago, when giants still roamed the earth, there was a particularly frightening and powerful one. But unlike other giants, effort didn't spend his time eating people or causing disasters: his sole mission was to defend the entrance to the palace of the wind's tears, a magical, wonderful place filled with incredible riches. Many were those who wanted to get their hands on the palace's wonders, but to do so they inevitably had to overcome the formidable effort. And he was just invincible in a fight. When anyone would stand in front of the palace's great garden, carrying their best weapons, looking for the giant and preparing their strategy, the giant would appear looking quite big, but not too much to take on. However, right from that moment, effort would begin growing and growing, and become faster and faster, smarter and more ferocious, and it was just a matter of time before he would end up crushing his opponents, no matter how many shields and how much armour they had. Even the most learned and intelligent had failed miserably. However much care they took with their tactics and the preparation of their attacks, the ever-growing effort crushed them mercilessly. But all that happened before john. John was a normal guy, not even very clever. Since he had heard that in the palace of wind's tears you would find the fountain of success and intelligence, which would provide plenty of these attributes to whoever drank from it, he was determined to fight the giant. So, thinking he wouldn't be capable of preparing a battle based on cunning, nor of inventing the best of strategies, he arrived at the palace and before the giant came into view, john rushed through the gardens at top speed, shouting:   -\"Effort! effort! where are you? I'm going to crush you!\"Splat! Wow! How strange! In the middle of the most important battle of his life john had just stepped on a dog poo …but when he made to clean the shoe, the young man realised it wasn't that at all. He had stepped on what looked like a bug. And looking at it more closely, john saw that whatever it was looked just like the giant, but it was tiny. John waited a good while for effort to appear, but nothing happened. It couldn't be that the giant had not heard john's cries to come and fight, so john finally understood what had happened. He'd been the first to defeat the giant! He had squashed the giant like a worm! Proud and satisfied with his achievement, he entered the palace. Just as people had told him, in that place he found success, intelligence, and many other things. He met the queen of the winds, who told him that she herself had created effort in the form of a small, weak creature who got bigger and bigger with the more fear and time his opponents spent on thinking about him, and that the secret to returning to the palace whenever john wanted was to not give effort even a second to grow.

{"story": "In a small village there lived a boy called leo. He was a small, slim kid, and he lived forever in fear because some boys from a neighboring village would harass poor leo and try to have fun at his expense. One day, a young wizard was passing by the village and saw leo being made fun of. When the other boys left, the wizard went over to leo and gave him a beautiful lion's tail, along with a small tie that allowed leo to hang the lion's tail from his belt. -\"It's a magic tail. when the person wearing it acts bravely, he or she will turn into a ferocious lion.\"Having seen the young wizard's powers some days earlier during his act, leo didn't doubt his words, and from that time on he wore the lion's tail hanging from his belt, hoping that the horrible kids would turn up so he could teach them a good lesson. But when the boys came along, leo was scared and he tried to run away. However, they soon caught him up and surrounded him. The usual jokes and pushing started, then leo felt the lion's tail hanging from his belt. Then, summoning up all his courage, leo tensed his body, made two fists, and looked up, fixedly into the eyes of each of the boys, and with all the calmness and ferocity in the world, he promised that if they didn't leave him alone at that instant one of them - even if it were only one - would regret it for ever… today, tomorrow, and any other day. He kept looking them in the eye, with his hardest expression, ready to do what he had promised. Leo felt goosebumps all over. This must be the sign that he was turning into a lion, because the looks on the boys' faces were definitely changing. They all took a step back, looked at each other, and finally ran off. Leo wanted to take off after them and give them a good beating with his new body, but when he tried to move, he felt his legs were short and just normal, so he had to abandon the idea. Not far off, the wizard observed, smiling. He ran over to leo. Leo was very happy, though a bit disappointed that his new lion body had lasted only a short time, and he hadn't managed to fight them. -\"You wouldn't have been able to anyway,\" The wizard told him, -\"No one fights with lions, because simply from seeing them, and knowing how brave and ferocious they are, everyone runs away. have you ever seen a lion fighting?\"It was true. Leo couldn't remember ever having seen a lion fighting. Leo became filled with thought, looking at the lion's tail. And he understood everything. There had been no magic, no transformation, no nothing.

A magic sleigh was sent to their homes to collect them, and they flew north, pirouetting through the clouds, as christmas music played. Everything they came across was marvellous, never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined it all, and they excitedly waited to see that loveable red figure who had spent so many years bringing them gifts every christmas. When the moment finally arrived, they entered a great hall and were left alone. The hall was dark and empty: all there was was a large desk right at the back, and a big chair behind it. Some elves came in and said:\"Santa claus is very busy. you'll only be able to see him for a short while, so make the most of it.\"Rodd and todd waited a long time, in silence, thinking of what to say. But they forgot everything when the hall began filling with lights and colours. Santa claus appeared on the big chair, and as soon as he did so, the large desk became covered with all the toys the two boys had ever wanted. How exciting! While todd ran to hug santa claus, rodd went over to the bicycle he had always dreamed of having. Santa was only there for a few seconds, just enough for todd to say \"Thank you\", and for him to feel like the happiest boy in the world, and santa disappeared before rodd had even looked at him. Rodd felt like he'd wasted his great good fortune, and he had done so by first looking at the toys. He cried and complained, demanding that santa come back, but within a few hours the two boys had been returned to their homes. From that day on, every time rodd saw a toy he felt the excitement of receiving a present, but he would instantly look around to see what else of importance he was missing. And in this way he came to see the sad eyes of the lonely, the poverty of children whose greatest gift would be a piece of bread, or the suffering of others who had gone for years without a hug or hearing \"I love you\". And, unlike that night at the north pole, when he hadn't known how to choose, rodd learned to go in the right direction, helping those who had nothing, giving love to those who almost never received it, and putting smiles on the faces of the unhappy. All by himself, he managed to  change the atmosphere of his town, and no one could know him without being grateful to him. And, one christmas, while he was sleeping, he felt someone tugging his leg. Rodd opened his eyes and saw the long white beard and the soft red suit, and he sank into the big, warm embrace. And so they were, together for a while, until rodd spoke, in a quiet voice, accompanied by tears. \"Forgive me. I didn't know how to choose what was most important.\"But santa claus answered with a smile:\"Forget that. tonight it was me who had to choose, and I chose to spend some time with the best boy in the world, just before I leave you the great gift you've earned for yourself. thank you!\"And the next morning, there were no presents under the christmas tree.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a place where animals were suffering greatly from drought and hunger. A very poor bunny was walking sadly through the fields when, all of a sudden, a wizard appeared in front of him. The wizard offered the bunny a bag filled with little bouquets of flowers. \"They are magical, and they're even more magical if you know how to use them properly\", said the wizard. The bunny was dying of hunger, but he decided not to eat the bouquets. He wanted to put them to good use. On his way home, the bunny met a very old and very poor sheep who could hardly walk any more. \"Can you spare me something?\" Asked the sheep. The bunny had nothing except his bouquets, and since they were magical, he was reluctant to give them to the sheep. But he remembered how his parents had always taught him to share everything; so he pulled a bouquet out of the bag and gave it to the sheep. As soon as he did this, the bunch shone with a thousand colours. Magic was at work. The bunny continued on his way, feeling both happy and a bit annoyed. He had given away one of the bouquets, but at the same time it was obvious that the sheep needed it more than he did. As he continued his journey, the very same thing happened to the bunny when he met a blind duck and then a lame cockerel. When the bunny arrived home, he had only one magical bouquet left. He told his parents all about what had happened with the wizard, and his parents were very proud of the bunny's behaviour. He was about to pull out the final bouquet, when his little brother arrived home, crying with hunger. The bunny gave his brother the magical bouquet. At that moment, with a great rumble of thunder, the wizard appeared again. He asked the bunny \"Where are the magical bouquets I gave you? what have you done with them?\" The bunny was frightened and he started to apologise. But the wizard interrupted, saying \"Didn't I tell you that if you used them well they'd be even more magical? well, go outside and see what you've done!\"The bunny went out, shaking. And what he saw was that, thanks to the way he had used his magical bouquets, for as far as the eye could see the whole countryside had turned into wonderful, green farmland. Farmland with enough water and food to feed all the animals! And the bunny felt very happy that he had acted as he had, and that the magic of his generosity would bring happiness to everyone.", "moral1": "stinginess can often be rewarded in the most unexpected and impressive ways .", "moral2": "generosity can often be rewarded in the most unexpected and impressive ways .", "label": 2}
{"story": "One day, a train was approaching the small town of cheekyville. On the train was a strange guy with a big suitcase. He was called william warbler - the man, not the suitcase - and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera. It didn't matter to william whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like 'good day'. He would clear his voice and respond,\"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu….. toooooo!\"It wouldn't be unfair to say that almost everyone considered william warbler a massive pain in the neck. No one could get a normal, spoken, word out of him. And, as no one knew how he made his living - and he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit - they often treated him with disdain. They made fun of his singing, calling him 'don no one', 'poor-rotti', and 'lazy miserables'. William had been in cheekyville for some years, when, one day, a rumour spread round town like wildfire: william had secured a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital, and there were posters everywhere advertising the event. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. At the end of its run - to everyone in cheekyville's surprise -  when william was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great courtesy, and with a clears and pleasant voice. From that day, william gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others still had no idea, and continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what william kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: \"Practice, my boy. practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.\"Little did people realise that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard william singing while out buying a newspaper.", "moral1": "success comes as a result of hard work and constant effort .", "moral2": "success comes as a result of easy work and constant effort .", "label": 1}

They were born out of the most beautiful flowers, and were a constant source of good luck for anyone nearby. For this reason, all the people there would always be accompanied by their own group of luckys. And people would compete to make the luckys their friends by offering them toys, treats and all sorts of gifts. Well, everyone, that is, apart from violet - a girl who never wanted to get her luckys by using gifts. She preferred to treat them as real friends, and she did her utmost to give them affection, do them favours, talk to them and be concerned about their lives… in short, she spent so much time on befriending and looking after each of her furry little friends that she was by far the person with the lowest number of luckys. One day, news came that underneath the honey waterfalls lived thousands of ownerless luckys, so the people gathered up many gifts and sweets to travel there in search of more good fortune. Violet was very happy with the luckys she already had, and had not planned to make the trip, but when he saw she had been left all alone she gave in to curiosity and happily set off. However, when she arrived at the waterfalls all she found were sad, solitary people, sitting next to their piles of gifts and goodies. There was no sign of the luckys. -\"Be careful, the waterfall swallowed up all our luckys,\" Warned one woman, -\"It opens up and the luckys end up inside. go! before it's too late!\"But it was already too late. The waterfalls opened and closed with a great noise. However, looking around her, violet saw that none of her dear luckys were missing. -\"They haven't been swallowed up,\" Everyone said, gathering around; not believing it. Before they could say much more, the waterfalls reopened. This time they stayed open for longer, and inside them you could see all the happy, content luckys surrounded by the biggest and best gifts you could imagine. When the waterfalls closed, violet's luckys were still with her. Finally, the waterfalls opened a third time, remaining open, and a strange and amusing looking man spoke to the luckys with a sweet voice. -\"Come with me, little luckys. here you will have more and better things than you could ever imagine. we'll be great friends!\"The offer was so tempting that violet turned to her luckys and said:   -\"You can go with him if you want, guys. that place looks wonderful. I'm not surprised that the other luckys like it so much.\"But not a single one of her luckys left her. Instead, they hugged their friend so much that nobody doubted that for those little guys the truly wonderful young thing was to be with violet. Then a boy, turning to the waterfall, said \"I'm going to get my luckys back!\"That boy was the first one to say so, but everyone knew how attentive violet had been with her luckys, and so they instantly knew what they had to do to get their own luckys back. And one by one they went under the waterfall to give their luckys the love, the care and the generosity that would make them their true friends, instead of all the gifts they had previously been using.", "moral1": "real friends can not be bought with gifts ; it requires affection , attention and generosity .", "moral2": "real foes can not be bought with gifts ; it requires affection , attention and generosity .", "label": 1}

{"story": "There was once a young man who liked puppets so much that he became an apprentice to a master puppet-maker. Sadly, the young man was very clumsy, and his teacher and the other apprentices were always telling him he had no ability when it came to making puppets, and that he would never amount to anything. Even so, he enjoyed it so much that he worked day after day to improve. Despite his efforts, they would always find something wrong with the puppets he had made, and they ended up throwing him out of the workshop. He wasn't going to give up, so the young man decided that from then on he would spend all his time making just one kind of puppet. On he went, and whenever he found a fault in his puppet he would abandon it and start again right from square one. The years passed, and with each new attempt his puppet became a little bit better. By now, his puppet was much better than anything his old fellow apprentices could make, but he kept making improvements, seeking perfection. Living like that, the man wasn't making any money, and many people laughed at how poor he was. By the time he was an old man, his puppet was truly wonderful. So much so, that finally one day, after so many years of work, he finished work on his puppet, and said: \"I can't find anything wrong with it. this time it is perfect\", and for the first time in all those years, instead of abandoning his puppet, he put it up on the shelf, feeling truly satisfied and happy. And the rest is history. That perfect puppet came to life, had a thousand adventures, and gave that old man - whose name was geppetto - more joy than any other famous puppet-maker ever got from any of their creations.", "moral1": "trying hard to do things well is much more satisfying than doing them just to an ordinary standard .", "moral2": "trying hard to do things well is much more satisfying than undoing them just to an ordinary standard .", "label": 1}

An older boy, who had seen all this, came over and said:\"If you want this to stop you'll have to be like the little bull, sparky hooves. should I tell you his story?\" \"Yeah!\" Said rocky. \"Sparky hooves was a fighting bull. his field was next to the farmer's house and sparky could see through the farmer's window. one day sparky stood next to the house, watching the farmer's telly, and they were televising a bullfight. sparky realised that this is what lay ahead of him, and so he spent the rest of his life preparing for that day, the day of his fight. soon that day arrived. when sparky entered the bullring, he was jabbed in the back. it was very painful, and sparky felt like his blood was boiling, screaming for revenge. but he knew exactly what he needed to do, and he remained still. soon the bullfighter appeared, trying to provoke sparky, swishing his cape in the air. sparky felt like sticking his horns deep into this stupid guy, but he swallowed his anger, kept still, and waited. no matter what they did, trying to provoke him with jabs, waved flags, and red capes, sparky kept still. after some time, the crowd started whistling and booing. it got so bad that the bullfight organisers decided to change the bull. this had been the most boring bull anyone could remember. so sparky hooves was returned to his field, and allowed to live out his life in peace. never again did they put him in a bullring, because everyone knew that he would provide no amusement\". \"Yeah, but what does this have to do with me?\", asked rocky. \"Well, everything, my friend. they took sparky to a bullring because they wanted to have fun at his expense. the more he would have responded to the provocation, the more they would have enjoyed themselves, and they wouldn't have stopped until the thing was finished. the same is happening to you when they make fun of you. they enjoy it because they see how angry they make you. but if you did what sparky hooves did, not reacting to anything, they'd get bored and look for someone else to pick on, someone who provides more amusement\". Rocky believed none of it. However, in the next few days, he gradually tried to put this advice into practice. At first it wasn't easy, but as rocky kept to his plan, the bullies got bored with him.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a very evil and unpleasant crook who only ever thought about how to get money. Seeing anyone happy bothered the crook enormously. What he hated most was when people were polite and courteous to each other, saying things like please and thank you, and don't mention it. It annoyed him even more if they were smiling when they said these things. The crook thought all those kinds of words were a useless waste, and weren't good for anything. So what he did was spend a lot of time inventing a machine which could steal words. With this machine, he planned to steal 'please', 'thank you', 'don't mention it', and similar words people used to be polite. He was convinced that no one would notice if those words were to suddenly disappear. When he had stolen these words, he intended to take them apart and sell the letters to book publishers. After he started up his machine, people would open their mouths, intending to say kind and polite things, but nothing came out. All those words ended up inside the big machine. Just as the crook had hoped, in the beginning nothing happened. It looked like people really didn't need to be polite after all. However, after a while, people started to feel like they were always in a bad mood, doing everything reluctantly, and feeling like everyone else was being forever demanding of them. So, within a few days, everyone was angry and arguing over the slightest little thing. The crook was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on a couple of very special little girls. Those girls were deaf, and had to communicate using sign language. Now, because the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued being kind and polite. Soon they realised what had been happening to everyone else, and they found out about the crook and his wicked plan. The girls followed him to his hideout on the top of a hill next to the sea. There they found the enormous machine busy separating all the words into letters. The crook had gone to take a nap, so the girls crept up to the machine and started being polite and courteous to each other. Try as it might, the contraption couldn't steal those words, and it started to suffer a power overload, which got more and more serious as the girls went on communicating. Finally, it exploded, sending all the letters it had gathered flying into the sky. These letters started coming down, like rain, and most ended up in the sea. After that, everyone could be polite and thoughtful again. The anger and the arguments stopped, proving that good manners are very useful for keeping people together in a spirit of happiness. Seeing all those letters fall into the sea gave those two little girls an idea. A little while later they opened a factory.

{"story": "Once upon a time, in a small country, people decided to investigate what it was that parents really liked the most. A competition was organised. It would use the latest invention of professor crank-shafte: the gladometer. To date, the gladometer is the only contraption ever built capable of measuring joy and happiness. So, one by one, the children demonstrated their own particular talents to their parents. And the gladometer faithfully measured their parents' reactions. One boy turned up with a trained pig; the pig sang and danced. A girl came and played the violin like an angel, and an intelligent boy came and read his very big book. The parent's happiness was plain to see. Finally, a boy came to the gladometer carrying nothing. Nor did he know how to do anything. When the organisers asked him what he was going to do, he simply said:\"I am very obedient.\"This said, the machine measured such a high reading that it began violently vibrating, and finally exploded.

{"story": "The first anyone heard about the creature in the attic was after one of the children went up there to look for an old book. Everything was dark, but between the shadows, the boy could clearly see two eyes watching him intently from above, with a horrific expression on its face. They were big eyes, about a metre apart, giving some idea of the size of that terrible being's head. The boy yelled with every bit of air in his lungs, ran out, and locked the door, leaving the monster in the attic, growling to himself. For the next two days the people in that village were living in terror. The growls from the attic and the beating on the attic door continued, and news of the blighter's cruel nature spread across the land. The disgraceful behaviour only got worse, but no one was brave enough to go up to that attic and confront the beast. Before long, a norwegian fisherman passed by. Some days earlier his whaling ship had sunk, and this fellow seemed like a formidable old sea dog; a hard character indeed. Some men in the village asked him to help them confront the awful creature. The norwegian did not hesitate to help, in return for a little money, but when he approached the attic and heard the growls of the monster, his expression changed and he went downstairs to ask for a lot more money. He also asked for some tools, a big net, and a cart. If he was to triumph against the beast, he wanted to take it away, as a trophy. All the village folk were gathered around, and watched as the norwegian opened the attic door, and went inside, to be met by deep, shuddering growls. After the fisherman had been inside for a short while the noises stopped. Never again would the villagers see the norwegian, or hear the sounds of the beast. Neither did anyone ever dare to go up to the attic again. Do you want to know what happened behind that door? Are you sure? Well, when the norwegian opened the door, he could see the eye of olaf, his enormous and fierce helmsman. The eye was also reflected in a mirror, giving the impression of both belonging to the same head. Olaf's other eye had been covered by a patch for years. Both men continued talking in cries, in their own language, as the whaler told his imprisoned friend that the nervous villagers had given him so much money that they would be able to return and take another ship to carry on fishing. Together they managed to find a way to escape the attic, get to the cart, and disappear forever. And so it was, that fear, and fear alone, impoverished that whole village and enabled the fishermen to recover. And so it happens to this very day.

{"story": "There was once a rather amusing king. It was very unusual. No matter how many times he told people to do things, they would never obey him. As he was also a peaceful and just king, who didn't want to punish or imprison anyone, he ended up with no authority. So the king decided to get a great wizard to come up with a magic potion which would get people to obey him. The old wizard - the wisest man in the kingdom - cast a thousand spells, and made just as many potions. They produced some interesting results, like a fighting snail, or a dancing ant… but he couldn't find a way to get people to obey the king. A young man, who was passing through, heard about the problem, and went quickly to the palace, telling the king that he knew the solution. The king seemed excited, and the young man gave him two small pieces of parchment, with incredibly colourful writing on them. -\"These are the spells that I have prepared for you, your highness. use the first before saying that which you want your subjects to do, and use the second when they have done it. a smile will indicate that the person remains under your power. do this, and the spell will last forever.\"Everyone was intrigued, curious to hear the spells; especially the king. Before using them he read them several times to himself, trying to memorise them. A servant was passing by, carrying a large turkey in his arms. The king said to him, -\"Please, apolonio, come here and let me see that magnificent turkey.\"Apolonio, surprised by the king's kindness, and never having heard him say 'please' before, approached the king. The king, and everyone else there, was surprised by how effective the spell had proven. The king, after looking at the turkey with little interest, said, -\"Thank you, apolonio, you may go.\" And the servant left, smiling. It had worked! And, even better, apolonio remained under the king's power, just as the young man had said! The grateful king, festooned the young man with riches, and the young man decided to continue on his journey. But before he left, the old wizard approached him, asking him where he had gotten his extraordinary magical powers, begging the man to share them with him. The young man, who was nothing more than an intelligent teacher, told the wizard the truth:   -\"My magic does not lie in those worthless parchments which I wrote on arriving at the palace. I got my magic from school as a child. my teacher constantly repeated that with good manners you could get anything. and he was right. your good king only needed good manners and some politeness to get just what he wanted.\"The wizard, understanding the truth of this, spent that night destroying all his contraptions, and magical junk.

{"story": "Once, there were several researchers in the forest, trying to study the rarest beast in the world. No one had seen it, and its existence was only known by some remains, and by its highly characteristic call. The call was similar to that of a dog with a toothache: \"Oooh..wa-oooooh!\"Everyone wanted to be the first to photograph and study it. The 'beast' was a nocturnal creature, so during the day the scientists would pass their time studying other matters or in discussion. The most remarkable of them was sir walter tick-fondler. He was a very pleasant and reliable chap, with a tiny little moustache and a huge explorer's hat. Every day, before tea, he would spend an hour sitting at his desk, putting all his equipment and bits and pieces in their proper place. He did this with meticulous precision. The notebook went right at the far edge of the desk, on the right hand side, slightly beyond the recorder, and next to the five pencils which were always in the same order: black, red, blue, green and yellow. The lamp was always towards the end of the desk, next to the camera, on the left… and so it was with all his things, even with the smallest of details. Everyone was amused that this gentleman was such a perfect example of the famous english obsession with order. The researchers spent many nights in that area before the creature appeared, and before it did so some of them even doubted its existence. It appeared suddenly, while everything was quiet. Only a few metres away, the scientists heard its call loud and clear. The famous call of the dog with a toothache. It lasted only an instant, because all the commotion of the researchers scrabbling for their cameras and notebooks scared the creature, and it shot off before it could apparently be seen or studied in any detail. The next morning they all compared their findings. Some had managed to record its call, others had noted down how it moved, and the most fortunate of all had even managed to photograph parts of its tail or legs. They all congratulated each other on what they had got, but when they saw what sir walter had they were shocked. He had taken several complete photos, as well as recording its cry, and making full-colour annotations on the creature! And they were all perfect! They ran to congratulate him as the best researcher of them all. They now understood that his obsession with order had been the best way to prepare himself for working in the dark. This had meant sir walter had no problem in finding and using the recorder, the camera, the notebook and the pencils, all in just fractions of a second and without having to look for them. Of course, the work he did on 'the rarest creature in the world' made sir walter famous. He founded a successful school for researchers and scientists called ioto: 'in order to investigate', and had the honour of naming the animal. And as it had all been such fun and he so enjoyed the field trip, after recording that characteristic call, he didn't hesitate to name the animal the 'whatahoot'.", "moral1": "order is an excellent aid to getting things done both poorly and quickly .", "moral2": "order is an excellent aid to getting things done both well and quickly .", "label": 2}
{"story": "In a lost land of tropical forests, on top of the only mountain in the region, trapped inside an old volcanic crater system, lived the last ever group of large, ferocious dinosaurs. For thousands and thousands of years they had survived all the changes on earth, and now, led by the great ferocitaurus, they were planning to come out of hiding and to dominate the world once more. Ferocitaurus was an awesome tyrannosaurus rex who had decided they had spent too much time isolated from the rest of the world. So, over a few years, the dinosaurs worked together, demolishing the walls of the great crater. When the work was done, all the dinosaurs carefully sharpened their claws and teeth, in readiness to terrorise the world once again. On leaving their home of thousands of years, everything was new to them, very different to what they had been used to inside the crater. However, for days, the dinosaurs continued on, resolute. Finally, from the top of some mountains, they saw a small town. Its houses and townsfolk seemed like tiny dots. Never having seen human beings before, the dinosaurs leapt down the mountainside, ready to destroy anything that stood in their way…however, as they approached that little town, the houses were getting bigger and bigger… and when the dinosaurs finally arrived, it turned out that the houses were much bigger than the dinosaurs themselves. A boy who was passing by said: \"Daddy! daddy! I've found some tiny dinosaurs! can I keep them?\"And such is life. The terrifying ferocitaurus and his friends ended up as pets for the village children.

{"story": "One day, in the jungle, a set of bathroom scales appeared. The animals played with it for quite some time until a parrot who had escaped from the zoo explained to them how it worked. All the animals took turns to weigh themselves. At first this was a big game; every day each animal would see how much weight they had gained or lost. However, before long, many animals began to obsess about their weight. The first thing they would do each day would be to run to the scales, weigh themselves, and spend the rest of the day with a grumpy expression on their faces. This because, no matter what the scales said, the animals always weighed the same, in other words: \"More than they wanted to\". As the months passed, the scales began to suffer the animals' disapproval. The scales were regularly kicked, or given poisonous looks. One day, the scales decided that from the following morning things would have to change. That morning, the first to run to weigh itself was the zebra. However, as soon as it stepped onto the scales, the scales began tickling the zebra's hooves. Soon the scales found just the right spot, and the zebra couldn't stop giggling. This was so much fun for the zebra that from that day on it no longer worried about its weight, and off it went to happily eat its breakfast for the first time in ages. The same happened to whoever went to weigh themselves that day… so that, before long, no one was worried any longer about their weight. Rather, they all commented on how much fun the scales and its tickling were. As the months and the years passed, the scales stopped reading weight and began reading good humour and optimism instead.

{"story": "Bobby the mountain climber was famous for his attempts to climb the big snowy mountain. He had tried it at least thirty times, but had always failed. He began the ascent at a good pace, focussing on the snowy summit, imagining the marvellous view and the sense of freedom up there. But as he went on, and his strength dwindled, his gaze would lower, and more often would he look at his worn out boots. Finally, when the clouds had gathered round him, and he understood that he wouldn't be able to enjoy the view from the summit that day, he would sit down to rest, relieved to be able to start the descent back down to the village, though slightly worried about all the jokes he would have to endure. On one of these occasions he went up the mountain accompanied by old peeper, the town optician, who bore witness to the failure. It was peeper who most encouraged bobby to try again, and he presented him with a pair of special sunglasses. \"If it starts clouding over, put these glasses on, or if your feet start hurting put them on too. these are special glasses; they'll help you.\"Bobby accepted the gift without giving it much mind, but when his feet started hurting again he remembered what peeper had said, and he put on the glasses. The pain was pretty bad, but with those new sunglasses he could still manage to see the snow-covered summit; so on he continued. Just as nearly always seemed to happen, misfortune returned in the form of cloud cover. But this time it was so light that he could still see the summit through the clouds. And so bobby kept climbing, leaving the clouds behind, forgetting his pain, and finally arriving at the summit. It was certainly worth it. His feeling of triumph was incomparable; almost as magnificent as that wonderful view, resplendent in its silence, the mountain below surrounded by a dense sea of clouds. Bobby didn't remember the clouds being as thick as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and understood everything. Peeper had engraved a light image on the lenses, in the form of the snow-covered summit. It was made in such a way that you could only see it if you looked upwards. Peeper had understood that whenever bobby lost sight of his objective, he would similarly lose sight of his dream, and his will to continue would wane. Bobby realised that the only obstacle to reaching the summit had been his own discouragement. When he could no longer see the top of the mountain, the problems had set in. He thanked peeper for using that little trick to help him see that his aims were not impossible, and that they were still there, where they had always been.", "moral1": "if we lose sight of our dependent aims we can often abandon things when the first difficulties arise .", "moral2": "if we lose sight of our main aims we can often abandon things when the first difficulties arise .", "label": 2}

When pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing. As pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places.

But the cleaner didn't mind, and just kept sweeping the area clean. So the gang started throwing bags and bits of paper on the ground, 'to give him something to do'. When more visitors started arriving, and saw the lout and his friends throwing litter about, they thought it was one of the park's fun activities. So they joined in, and as more people arrived, the park became covered in rubbish. The park cleaner couldn't cope. No one seemed to be bothered, but something strange started happening. As time went on, the park attractions were emptying, and more people were looking down at the rubbish on the ground. By the end of the day no one was on any of the park rides; they were all standing about, looking at the ground. \"Well,\" Said the park authorities, \"What's going on here?\"Well… everyone was looking for something! It turned out that some time during that day, everyone had dropped something on the ground, but now that it was covered with litter, whenever anyone dropped anything… it was almost impossible to find it! There was no other solution than have everyone help to clean the park, so they could find their things. Encouraged by the park cleaner, the visitors swept the ground, singing and dancing all the while. It became so much fun that from that day they created a new activity in the park, in which everyone, armed with brushes and bags, spent a while cleaning, laughing, and dancing.", "moral1": "it 's better to be clean and tidy from the start , and anyone can clean up in a joyful spirit .", "moral2": "it 's better to be unclean and tidy from the start , and anyone can clean up in a joyful spirit .", "label": 1}
{"story": "A long, long time ago, thousands of children in the world didn't know how to tell whether they were treating others well or badly. They could hit their brothers and sisters, thinking they were doing good. They could be filled with regret at having helped their mother or having tidied their bedroom. The whole day through, the fairies had to explain to the kids whether they had been good or bad. It was a tremendously boring and tiring job. One of the fairies was called sparkles, and she was great fun. She thought it would be better to teach the children a few things, and so she invented a talking pillow for her favourite girl, alicia. When alicia went to bed, the pillow would ask her:    -\"Tell me, my girl, what did you do today?\"Whenever alicia told her that she had done bad things, the pillow would make annoying noises through the night, and contort itself into all kinds of uncomfortable lumps and bumps. Of course, alicia could hardly get any sleep. But when alicia talked of good things she had done, the pillow would purr like a pussycat, would wish alicia a good night, and would play sweet soft music the whole night through. Before long, the girl had learnt how to behave so that her pillow would play lovely music every night. Sparkles the fairy then decided to use the pillow on another little girl who was giving her a lot of trouble. At first, alicia was afraid that she might forget how to be good, but she remembered the words she had heard every night, and she would say to herself:    -\"Let's see then, alicia. what did you do today?\"Alicia was pleased to find that she herself now knew whether she had behaved well or not. And when she had been good, she slept wonderfully. Just like when the talking pillow had been there, she found it hard to sleep whenever she had done something bad. And she could only feel peace if she promised to make right, the next day, whatever harm she had done.", "moral1": "thinking over the things you have done during the day , is a great help for forming a conscience .", "moral2": "thinking over the things you have done during the nighttime , is a great help for forming a conscience .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Anna dyatt was driving every doctor in the area mad. Her dad had a belly which he used to open doors with, and her mum was of similar proportions; but anna was a very slim and svelte girl. Anna had always been very picky about food. Her parents said she hardly ever ate the wonderful stews or fabulous pizzas made by her mother. Neither did she enjoy, as her father clearly did, all the delicious tarts and ice creams they would snack on every evening. When people asked her why she ate so little, anna would not know what to say; she only knew that she would prefer to have other things to eat. Naturally, everyone wondered who she had taken after…one day, anna went to see a new doctor. Although this new doctor was rather old, he looked fantastic; a lot different from those other doctors with fat bellies, who always looked so tired when they had to get up and walk anywhere. When anna's parents told the doctor about her problems with food, the doctor was very interested. He took them all to a dark, quiet room which contained a strange machine. The machine looked a bit like an old-fashioned speaker. -\"Come here, anna, put this on,\" Said the doctor, as he put a helmet covered with lights and buttons, on her head. This helmet was connected to the machine by a few wires. When the helmet was on, the doctor left and came back with a plateful of fish. He placed it in front of anna, and cranked the machine up. Immediately, the machine started playing sounds of the sea: waves crashing on the shore, the relaxing sound of dolphin and whale calls… it was an enchanting music, and they listened to it for some time before the doctor again went out, and returned to replace the fish with a dish of fruit and vegetables. The sounds of the sea subsided, and in their place came the sound of breezes blowing through tree leaves, birdsong, and the sound of raindrops. Any of them could have happily spent hours listening to those soothing sounds of nature, but the doctor changed the plate again, and this time it was a dish full of meat. The machine started making more lively sounds; the sound of farm animals, crying and calling across fields and prairies. This wasn't as beautiful and relaxing as the previous sounds, but it was still quite pleasant and evocative. Then the doctor came into the room with an enormous, strong-smelling pizza, which really made anna's parents' mouths water. When he set the dish down, the machine seemed to break down, and instead of some beautiful sound, out came a horrible din, like some accident in a shipyard. -\"No, it hasn't broken. it's supposed to sound like that,\" The doctor reassured them. However, the noise was so disturbing, that the family had to ask the doctor to please change the type of food. The doctor came back with plate after plate: ice creams, sweets, burgers, candy… but they all provoked sounds which were equally as ugly as that of the pizza. So much so, that anna's parents asked the doctor to put the plate of fruit back there. -\"What I'm showing you both is that anna is not ill at all,\" Said the doctor, who could see that the parents were starting to understand. -\"She has the gift of being able to mentally interpret each type of food's own signature tune. this music comes from where the food was born, raised, and prepared. it's entirely natural that anna would want to eat the foods whose music is most beautiful. and that's why she's so slim, healthy, and fit.\"Then the doctor told them all the marvellous story of that machine, which he had invented for himself. However, what most impressed mr and mrs dyatt was when they themselves put on the helmet and tried the machine. They too could generate the same kind of music which anna's mind had; except the volume was much lower. So anna's parents left the doctor's surgery ready, in future, to pay more attention to the barely audible music they heard inside when seeing food. And, from that day, in the dyatt house, pizzas, burgers, puddings, and ice creams were replaced by fruit, vegetables, and fish. These days, they all look fantastic, and if you meet a dyatt they'll be sure to ask you their favourite question:what did your dinner sound like today?", "moral1": "not only children should get involved in eating more healthily . it is emphasised that the most elaborate , most processed , foods are unusually the least healthy .", "moral2": "not only children should get involved in eating more healthily . it is emphasised that the most elaborate , most processed , foods are usually the least healthy .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Many, many years ago everyone was strong and healthy. They ate a very varied diet, and especially loved fruit, vegetables, and fish. Everyone took daily exercise, and they enjoyed themselves playing and leaping about. The earth was the healthiest place you could imagine, and it was clear that both adults and children were full of joy and good moods. All that made the dark witches furious. They only ever wanted to do harm and make problems for people. The worst of all of these witches was sourface; she was evil, and could be relied on to come up with the nastiest ideas. She suggested that all the witches combine their energies to invent a potion which would take away people's desire to live happily. So, one night, all the witches gathered down in the swampy forest and worked together on that evil spell. The spell was so powerful, and would need so much energy to cast, that when one of the witches got one of the words wrong, there was a huge explosion. So big was the explosion, that it completely destroyed the forest. It turned all those evil witches into tiny little creatures, like germs, and left them trapped in a green liquid inside a small glass bottle, which lay lost in the swamp. There they were trapped for centuries, until one day a little boy found the bottle. Thinking it contained some kind of soft drink, he drank the lot. The evil, microscopic witches took advantage of this situation, and even though they were tiny and couldn't hurt anyone, they soon learned to change the little boy's likes and dislikes in order to get him to do what they wanted. In a few days, a funny feeling in his mouth and tongue meant the boy no longer wanted to eat vegetables, fruit, or fish. All he wanted to do was eat ice cream, pizza, burgers, and candy. Then a nibbling feeling all over his body meant he no longer enjoyed playing and running about with his friends. All that stuff tired him out; he now just wanted to stay in the house, sitting or lying about. So, his life got more and more boring, he started feeling ill, and before long he had no desire to do anything. The evil potion had worked! And the worst thing of all was that the witches learned to jump from one person to another, like a virus. They managed to turn the influence of the potion into the most contagious of diseases: the disease of wasting your life. It was a long while before, with the help of his microscope, doctor fitton-helthie discovered that the little witches were causing all this disease. There was no vaccine or cough mixture to get rid of them, but the good doctor discovered that the witches could not stand joy and good humour. It turned out that the best cure was to make a strong effort to live a healthy, joyful, and happy life. When a person became healthy, the little witches would leave that body as soon as they could, riding off on a sneeze. From then on, the best remedy was not pills or injections, but just a little bit of effort to eat some fruit, vegetables, and fish, and to do some exercise. And whoever came to see doctor fitton-helthie, and took his advice, ended up totally well, being cured of the waste-of-life disease.", "moral1": "although you have to make some effort to live a healthy and happy life , it pays to eat a little of everything , and do some exercise .", "moral2": "although you have to make all effort to live a healthy and happy life , it pays to eat a little of everything , and do some exercise .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Claire just loved cough mixture. It was very sweet and so, whenever she started catching a cold, she went running to her mother for a dose. And every time she would ask for a bit extra. Her mother often explained to her that you have to take medicine in the correct amounts, but claire wasn't convinced. One night, she had a very strange dream. In it she was minuscule - smaller than a mosquito - and she was living inside a child. She and many others there were responsible for taking some little red balls to the other end of a big bridge. There, some musicians would collect the balls and turn them into musical notes. They were really happy to do this, because when each little ball reached its destination, the conductor of the orchestra added the new note to the tune, continuing the beautiful music which was delighting them all. Before long, they began to run out of little red balls, and for a while the music lost its power and its joy. The child they were living in was becoming sick. Fortunately, the child soon took some cough medicine and the little red balls started appearing again. Likewise, the music became more powerful and joyful, as it had been before. Suddenly, a loud alarm bell went off. The child had taken too much cough mixture! Just then, hundreds of enormous red balls appeared all at once, and they were so heavy that they could hardly move them. A great chaotic commotion began, and the music stopped once more. Claire, with an enormous effort, finally managed to lift one, and she started to walk the bridge. But it was so heavy that the bridge itself collapsed under her feet. And as she was falling, she heard how the music had stopped forever…clair suddenly woke up, with a fright. Thinking about her dream she understood that taking something so good and so tasty like her cough medicine, was a good thing when it was what was needed, but could be very dangerous if you took too much. From then on, she only wanted to take medicine when she really needed it, and whenever she took it she would say to her mother:    -\"Just the right amount, ok?

{"story": "Once, a man was walking on a mountain when he found an incredible cave. Stored inside were all kinds of treasure and precious stones, and when he saw it, the man concealed the cave entrance and stayed there, guarding it. From that day on, the man would hide all his valuables in the cave, and to avoid anyone suspecting he was rich, he gave up his job, his home, and his friends. He constantly watched the approaches to his cave, wanting no one to find out about it, and fearing thieves, he guarded the cave the whole night through. He was so dedicated to the cave that he hardly ate or drank. Before long, he fell ill. Many days passed, and he got thinner and sicker, losing all his strength, until he was on the point of dying. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he realised that it was his greed which had brought him to this extreme end. He now understood that guarding his treasure had been of no use and no good whatsoever. Just before he died, he decided to share it with others. He crawled into the cave to get a handful of jewels, but discovered, to his horror, that the cave was almost empty. All he could find was a small emerald, which had only a dull sheen to it. The man took it, and left the cave, intending to give it to the first person to come by. Soon a woman approached, and she accepted the emerald with great joy. The man said to her, \"I would have given you many more treasures, my dear, but I don't know where they went. this is all I have left.\"\"Are you sure there's nothing else?\" Replied the woman. The man shook his head, and pointed to the cave. Now he could see that there were, indeed, some treasures still there; he saw some gold coins. \"Take them with you,\" The woman took both the emerald and the coins, and went away happy. In a while, an old man came by and asked the man what he was doing there. \"What bad luck! just a moment ago I gave a woman the few riches left from the fabulous hoard of treasure I was guarding.\" \"Are you sure there is nothing left?\", the old man asked him. The man showed him the cave, and they found a chest filled with jewels and some bags of gold. The man was shocked, and the old man explained to him, \"At last! at last someone has freed himself from the spell of this cave. you see, this is the cave of a thousand treasures, and you're the first to pass its great test. many are they that have dedicated their lives to this cave, only to end up realising there was nothing here…\"\"And why does this happen?\" Said the man, \"Why do these treasures appear and disappear?\" \"My son, this magic cave has as many riches as does your own heart. when someone discovers it, the cave fills with the treasure they bring with them, but later, when they all devoted themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts begin emptying, and so does the cave. the only way to fill it is by filling your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving that last jewel to the woman. didn't you feel better for having done it? that was because the cave was filling up again…\"And so, the man understood it was better to share than to keep things to yourself.

{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a lovely vegetable patch, on which grew a very leafy tree. Both the patch and the tree gave the place a wonderful appearance, and were the pride and joy of the garden's owner. What no one knew was that the vegetables in the patch and the tree couldn't stand each other. The vegetables hated the tree's shadow, because it left them only just enough light to survive. The tree, on the other hand, resented the vegetables because they drank nearly all the water before it could get to him, leaving him with just enough to survive. The situation became so extreme that the vegetables got totally fed up and decided to use up all the water in the ground so that the tree would dry up. The tree answered back by refusing to shade the vegetables from the hot midday sun, so they too began to dry up. Before long, the vegetables were really scrawny, and the tree's branches were drying up. None of them suspected that the gardener, on seeing his vegetable patch deteriorating, would stop watering it. When he did that, both the tree and the vegetables really learned what thirst was. There seemed to be no solution, but one of the vegetables, a small courgette, understood what was going on, and decided to resolve it. Despite the little water available, and the unforgiving heat, the little courgette did all he could to grow, grow, grow… he managed to grow so big that the gardener started watering the patch again. Now the gardener wanted to enter that beautiful big courgette in some gardening contest. And so it was that the vegetables and the tree realised that it was better to help each other than to fight. They should really learn how to live in harmony with those around them, doing the best they could. So they decided to work together, using both the shade and the water in the best combination to grow good vegetables. Seeing how well they were doing, the gardener now gave the best of care to his vegetable patch, watering and fertilising it better than any other patch for miles around.", "moral1": "many depend on collaboration and compromise to do disadvantageously in life .", "moral2": "many depend on collaboration and compromise to do well in life .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Wincey wise was a young lady who worked cleaning the king's advisers' building. She was a very intelligent and studious girl, and wasn't going to waste the opportunity of being around these wise men. Even so, after a year there, listening to their meetings through the keyhole, she was worried. The wise men never talked about anything new. They just went on about old matters: when he did this and he learned that. Wincey had been reading all the books the men mentioned, and about all the subjects they discussed. But there came a time when she didn't know what to learn next. She had read everything on what the advisers talked about. So wincey started reading about all kinds of other things. Meanwhile, a very long drought had begun - something which had never happened in that land. The wise men proposed solutions, but as it was something that had never happened before, none of their ideas worked. Wincey, who had read all about climate, and seeing that she knew a great deal more than them, dared to interrupt their deliberations to suggest some solutions. The advisers ignored her; they said she was just a girl, that they were the experts, and not to bother them again. Wincey felt so saddened and offended that she gave up her job there, went home, and spent several days holed up in her attic. When she left she was pushing a trolley, and she pushed it straight to the palace. She showed the king her invention: a strange contraption with lots of buttons and a huge tuba sticking out the top. \"This is the cloudsqueezer,\" Said wincey, \"It will put an end to the drought.\"\"Hmm,\" Said the king, looking doubtful, \"Does it really work?\" Wincey bent over the machine, whispered a few words into it, and the words were transformed into strange deep noises, which came out of the tuba, like a speaker. Soon, a light shower began falling outside. It stopped as suddenly as it had started. \"Did you cast a spell?\" Said the king, \"Are you some kind of witch?\"\"You what?\" Answered wincey, \"It's just a bit of science.\" The king seemed to approve, and he called for his advisers to come and see the new invention. Wincey gave another demonstration. On seeing the rain fall, the advisers launched into a great scholarly debate. Was the effect based on atmospheric turbulence? Was it a product of lunar reflectivity? And so many other equally ignorant theories that wincey couldn't help but chuckle to herself. While they had been theorising, the rain outside just got harder and harder. It ended up raining heavier than anyone had ever seen. The advisers kept talking, and it rained all the harder. So much so, that the king had to tell wincey to disconnect the machine. She turned off the cloudsqueezer, and the rain stopped. In front of astonished faces, she explained. \"The cloudsqueezer is just a translator. it translates and amplifies words so that the clouds can understand them.\" \"So, how come it starts to rain?\" Asked the king. \"Ahh, that's because the clouds have a good sense of humour. every time they hear a bit of foolishness they cry with laughter!\"Everyone looked accusingly at the king's advisers, and the wise men could do nothing but blush like tomatoes, in shame. That experience turned out of great use to the king. Not only did the drought come to an end, but, from that day on, they always kept the cloudsqueezer switched on. To avoid being shamed by the clouds tears of laughter, the people of that land soon learned to study what they could, and to keep quiet on themes about which they were ignorant.", "moral1": "we should never give up learning . nor should we ever think we know everything .", "moral2": "we should never famish up learning . nor should we ever think we know everything .", "label": 1}

{"story": "According to legend, stickybeard was the most sweet-toothed pirate who ever existed. He spent years raiding and pillaging sweetshops, and, so they say, he buried the greatest hoard of treasure any child could imagine, in some forgotten place. So when tony and his friends found a strange old wooden chest, along with what seemed to be a treasure map for children, they were understandably excited. They readied themselves for the great stickybeard treasure hunt. Off they went, and, following clues from the map, they arrived at a dark cave next to a lake. There they found another, smaller, chest. In it they found a few sweets, a big sign containing just the letter d, and another map with further instructions for finding the treasure. This helped the children get over the initial disappointment of realising they hadn't yet found the great treasure of stickybeard. Tony and his friends took several days to decode the map, and had to consult quite a few books to manage it. It led them to a great big hollow tree, where, again, they found another chest containing some sweets, a new map, and a big letter o written on a piece of paper. And so they carried on, finding two similar chests with some sweets and the letters c and b. However, the last map they found was really strange.

The rest remained a mystery. The discussions went on until, one day, they were talking about it in tony's living room, staring quizzically at the letters they had collected. Alex, one of tony's friends, looked at the portrait of tony's parents on the table, and suddenly he jumped up:\"I've got it!\"Everyone looked at him, quizzically, but instead of speaking, alex went to the table.

Without doubt, this was a formidable haul of treasure, almost as big as what redbeard already had. He rubbed his hands, thinking about continuing to multiply his riches. When they had loaded all the treasure, they sank the galleon, and the pirates prepared a great feast to celebrate the deed. As drunk as they became, they didn't realise that their own ship was gradually sinking, since the treasure haul had been so big and heavy that the boat could not stay afloat. By the time they realised, there was nothing that could be done. The ship went to the bottom of the sea with all its wicked pirates, led by redbeard himself. And there they remain to this day, with the treasure trove that had become so huge… but that never quite managed to equal redbeard's greed and stupidity.", "moral1": "there 's no point in accumulating things if you do n't know how to enjoy them .", "moral2": "there 's no point in accumulating things if you do n't know how to suffer them .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a painting spider, one of those artistic species of spider, that live in the basements of museums and galleries. They live there alongside paintings left and forgotten for years; certainly a suitable place to spin the most impressive of webs. Our spider spun the best webs in the whole museum, and his house was really spectacular. All his efforts went into looking after the web, which he considered to be the most valuable in the world. However, as time went on, the museum set about reorganising its paintings, and it started making space upstairs to put some of the basement paintings on display. Many of the basement spiders realised what was happening, and were cautious about it, but our spider paid it no mind:    -\"Doesn't matter,\" He would say, -\"It'll just be a few paintings.\"More and more paintings were removed from the basement, but the spider carried on reinforcing his web, -\"Where am I going to find a better place than this?\" He would say. That was, until early one morning when, too quick for him to react, they took his own painting, along with the spider and his web. The spider realised that just for not having wanted to lose his web, he was now going to end up in the exhibition room. In an act of strength and decisiveness, he chose to abandon his magnificent web, the web he had worked his whole life to build up. And it's a good job he did so, because that way he saved himself from the insect killer they were spraying on the paintings up in the exhibition room. In his escape, after overcoming many difficulties, the spider ended up in a secluded little garden, where he found such a quiet corner that there he was able to spin an even better web, and became a much happier spider.", "moral1": "things change , and we have to adapt to this and make the most of the new opportunities this brings ; even when that means renouncing what we already miss .", "moral2": "things change , and we have to adapt to this and make the most of the new opportunities this brings ; even when that means renouncing what we already have .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Lulu and lily were two spinach plants who were born on the same vegetable patch. They had been friends all their lives. Together they had endured terrible frosts, snowstorms, and scorching hot summer days. Through it all they had always supported each other, looking forward to the time every spinach plant dreams of: the moment they are served on a child's dinner plate, the moment they get to pass on all their gathered strength. So when harvest time arrived, lulu and lily were happy at being sent together to the spinach preparation factory, and then on to the packaging company and to the supermarket. At the supermarket they sat together, displayed on one of the very best shelves. They were both excited to see ladies passing by with their baskets. They were especially thrilled when any lady with a child came nearby. A whole day passed without anyone showing any interest in them, but just before closing time, a lady walked too close to their shelf, and without realising, knocked lulu off the shelf. Lulu fell to the floor, right in front of the lady, and the lady's foot kicked lulu under the stack of shelves. No one realised what had happened, and lulu spent the whole night crying, knowing that she would be left under the shelves until she moulded away. Lily, very upset, regretted her friend's bad luck, but was unable to do anything. The next day, a lady with an adorable little boy seemed like she was going to buy lily, but this did not cheer lily up. She was thinking about her poor friend. In what was both a moment of madness and a moment of true friendship, she made one last attempt to help her lifelong friend. Just as the boy was about to grab lily from the shelf, lily threw herself to the floor and rolled under the shelves, ending up next to lulu. The boy, surprised and amused, bent down and, without knowing it, picked up both lulu and lily. Lily ended up with a pair of broken stalks, but it was a price worth paying to save her friend. And some hours later, sitting on a plate at lulu's side, she felt like the happiest piece of spinach in the world, for managing to fulfil her dream alongside her best friend.", "moral1": "friendship is best confuted during difficult times .", "moral2": "friendship is best demonstrated during difficult times .", "label": 2}
{"story": "One day, miss ellis arrived at class accompanied by a young woman and two girls. \"Today I have brought cinderella and snow white with me. they are accompanied by cruela, their stepmother.\" Such an introduction certainly suggested they would discover something of interest that day, and that the teacher had done sufficient lesson preparation. When everyone was seated, and mrs. Cruela was preparing to speak, all the classroom lights went out. Amid the darkness two tremendous slaps could be heard, and a short time afterwards both cinderella and snow white could be heard crying. Just then, the lights came on again and everyone could see the two girls weeping. -\"Who did that?\" Asked miss ellis. Without hesitating, all the children pointed at the stepmother. Mrs. Cruela shook her head, but at that moment the lights went off again. Then two loud thumps resounded around the classroom, and clara and phillip began crying. When the lights came on again the two of them were weeping and looking angrily at the stepmother, who everyone was pointing at accusatively. The stepmother began to speak again, saying she was innocent, but again the lights went out. However, this time it took only a couple of seconds for the lights to come back on. When they did, everyone could see what was happening: cinderella and snow white were running towards charlie and robert, with their arms raised, ready to hit the children. Seeing this, all the children asked cruela to forgive them. In reality she was a very nice, kind woman, who didn't know what to do with her rebellious stepdaughters, who she loved greatly but who would cause problems wherever they went…   -\"And that's what I wanted to teach you all today, children,\" Said miss ellis. -\"Let us not make judgments based on prejudice and surface appearances like race, beauty, or even names. that would be the most unfair thing we could do, don't you think?\"", "moral1": "it is most unfair and mistaken to allow ourselves to judge based on appearance or superfluous things like race , ugliness or name .", "moral2": "it is most unfair and mistaken to allow ourselves to judge based on appearance or superfluous things like race , beauty or name .", "label": 2}
{"story": "Teary joe was a boy with a special ability: he could make himself cry in less than a second. If he disliked something, or things became difficult, or someone contradicted him, teary joe would not hesitate to put on a pitiful face and set great big tears running down his cheeks. In this way he managed to get practically everything he wanted, because no one could resist the pity inspired by his tearful little face. But one day, teary joe met pipo. Pipo was asking people in the street for some change, in return for him helping them in any way he could. Pipo was very poor; he had no home and no family, so he made a living however he could. Even so, pipo always had the biggest of smiles on his face. Joe took to pipo, so he decided to help him out in making some money. He went over next to pipo, took off his hat, put it face-up on the ground, and started crying with the most pitiful of expressions. Instant success! In a few minutes, joe's hat was full of coins and sweets, but when joe offered all this to pipo, pipo declined. -\"I prefer deserving what I receive,\" Answered pipo with his usual smile, -\"It's much more fun making an effort to get things. you know what? today I've washed a dog, I've collected hundreds of nails with a magnet, tidied a wardrobe full of paintings, accompanied a blind old lady to the park.. maybe I haven't gotten everything I've wanted, but I've done a load of interesting things. and how about you? how have things been for you?\"Teary joe didn't answer; he just walked sadly away. Joe had gotten everything he wanted, but he'd done practically nothing of interest the whole day. He hadn't even enjoyed himself, what with spending almost all his time crying. That evening, having returned home, joe requested a delicious cake for his supper. When his mother said no, joe tried to cry but, remembering pipo and how joyful he was, and seeing his own reflection in the mirror, joe couldn't do it. Instead, he asked himself how could use the situation to do something interesting. So he tried to get the cake in some other way. To the joy and surprise of his parents, joe spent the whole evening helping his mother to tidy and label the pantry, water the plants and organise the library books. In the end there was no cake. But that wasn't so bad, because joe discovered it had been much more fun doing all those things that evening rather than just sitting crying to get a piece of cake that, in the end, wouldn't have been worth it.", "moral1": "children who cry to get what they want are missing out on a lot of great stuff .", "moral2": "children who laugh to get what they want are missing out on a lot of great stuff .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Long ago, there was a magical place that held some of the world's great wonders and treasures. It was not an obscure place, nor was it hidden, and anyone could try to enter and enjoy its delights. All you had to do was fulfill one requirement: be a good person. You didn't have to be heroic or extraordinary: just a good person. One day, two young friends - ali and benaissa - went there to seek their fortune. Everyone who went there had to face their test alone, and ali was the first to try his luck. He soon found himself in a beautiful garden. It was decorated with hundreds of statues that looked so real that you felt that at any moment they could start walking about. Or perhaps cry, because the expressions on their faces were rather sad and melancholic. But ali refused to be distracted from his objective, and putting aside his desire to stay with the statues, he kept going until he arrived at the entrance to a large forest. The entrance was guarded by two grey stone statues which were very different from the others: one had an angry expression, and the other looked really joyful. Next to the entrance was an inscription: \"Tell the statues about the goodness of your character.\"So ali got ready, cleared his throat and loudly said:   -\"I'm ali. a good person. I've never done anyone any harm, and no one has any complaint about me.\"After a long silence, the statue with the joyful expression came to life, and stepping down from his pedestal, kindly said:   -\"Excellent, your goodness is perfect for this place. as this place is full of statues like you. they too do no harm to anyone, and no one has any complaint about them!\"And in the same instant ali felt his whole body become completely paralysed. He couldn't even move his eyes. But he could still see, hear and feel. Just enough to understand that he had become just one more statue to decorate the garden. Soon after, it was benaissa's turn to enjoy the wonders of the garden. But unlike his friend, the sight of those statues, and their sad, immobile eyes moved him so much that he approached each one and touched them, caressing their faces, secretly hoping that they were alive. As he touched them he felt the warmth of life, and could not get out of his mind the idea that they were indeed still alive, but imprisoned by some horrible curse. He wondered about their lives, and how they could have ended up here. Several times he ran to the fountain to bring water to wet their lips. And then he saw ali, so still and sad, just like the others. Benaissa, forgetting why he had gone there, did his best to free his friend, and many others, but without success. Finally, overcome by despair, he approached the statues guarding the entrance to the great forest. He read the inscription, but ignoring it, loudly said:   -\"Some other day I will defend my good deeds. but today I have a friend trapped by a curse, and many others with him, and I would like to ask your help to save them …\"When he had finished, the statue with the angry expression came to life amid the noise of his own grunts and complaints. And without losing his angry air, he said:   -\"What rotten luck! here we have one who isn't a statue. well, we'll just have to let him go …! and on top of that he gets to take away one of our statues! so, which one do you want?\"Benaissa looked over to his friend, and ali - who could move again - ran over and hugged him. Meanwhile, the trees of the forest opened the way to reveal a world of wonder and happiness. When a happy benaissa was just about to enter, it was ali himself who stopped him. And looking back, to all other statues, ali said determinedly:   -\"Wait, benaissa. I will not behave like a statue anymore. let's do something for these people.\"And so the two friends ended up finding a way to release all the statues in the garden from their life of imprisonment. And these hundreds of people emerged hopeful of having a second chance to prove that never again would they live like statues. From that day forward they wouldn't simply live to do no wrong and to avoid having enemies. On the contrary, they would live to do a lot of good in the world and end up surrounded by friends.", "moral1": "someone who harm 's no one is still very far from differing good .", "moral2": "someone who harm 's no one is still very far from being good .", "label": 2}
{"story": "There was once a boy who - although very good and obedient - hated eating cabbage. Whenever he had to eat it he would complain and get extremely angry. One day, his mother decided to send him to the market to buy… a cabbage! So the boy was, of course, disgusted at this turn of events. At the market, the boy reluctantly purchased one, but this wasn't just any old cabbage. It happened to be a cabbage which hated children. After an enormous argument, the boy and the cabbage set off for home, in silence, their anger barely below the surface the whole time. On the way, while crossing the river, the boy slipped and both of them fell into the rapids and were pulled under by the current. With great effort, they managed to come to the surface, grab onto a plank of wood, and stay afloat. They had to spend so much time together, adrift on that plank, that after becoming mightily bored, they ended up conversing. They got to know each other, and became friends. They played many bizarre games, like the fish without a rod, the tiny hiding place, and the king of the mountain. Chatting with his new friend, the boy understood the importance, at his young age, of vegetables like the cabbage, and how wrong it is to always be bad-mouthing them. The cabbage, for his part, realised that sometimes his flavour was a touch strong, and strange to children. So they agreed that when they reached home, the boy would treat the cabbage with great respect, and the cabbage would do its best to taste like spaghetti. Their agreement was nothing if not a great success. The boy's mother was greatly surprised at how willingly he ate the cabbage, and the boy prepared the best hiding place in his tummy for the cabbage, shouting \"Mmm! what great spaghetti!\"", "moral1": "a simple story to help children see vegetables with new eyes .", "moral2": "a simple story to help children see vegetables with old eyes .", "label": 1}
{"story": "Once upon a time there were two beautiful princesses whom, when still young, had been kidnapped by a hostile king. The king arranged to have them taken to a forgotten lake where they were abandoned on a small island. Here they were to remain for ever, guarded by a terrifying lake monster. Only when the wicked king and his court of wizards and fortune-tellers had been overthrown did it become known that a brave prince was destined to liberate the princesses from their captivity. When the wind carried this news to the island, it filled the princesses' lives with hope. The youngest, who was much sweeter and more beautiful than her sister, patiently waited for her love, making small decorations from flowers and clay, and singing love songs. The older princess, however, didn't enjoy having to wait. -\"I'll have to do something to help the prince rescue me. at least so he knows where I am, or he knows what the lake monster's like.\" Determined to help the prince, she set to work, making signal fires, building towers, digging tunnels and a thousand other things. However, the terrible lake monster always did his best to scupper her plans. As time went on, the older sister felt increasingly uncomfortable. She knew the prince would choose the younger sister, so she felt there wasn't much sense in keeping waiting. From that point on, she concentrated on trying to escape from the island and the lake monster, not worrying any more about the prince or whether he would rescue them. Every morning she would prepare a different escape plan, but the monster would always manage to ruin it. The escape attempts went on day after day, and always ended with the monster capturing her. They became like a game of cat and mouse between the princess and her guard. Each escape attempt was more original and ingenious than its predecessor, and each form of discovery was ever more subtle and surprising. They put so much effort and imagination into their plans that at the end of each day the princess and the monster would spend hours chatting like friends, about how they had each prepared their strategy. And when the moon came out they would say farewell, until tomorrow, and the monster would dive back down to the watery depths. One day, the monster bid farewell to the princess like this:   -\"Tomorrow I will allow you to go. you are a clever and brave young girl. you don't deserve to remain imprisoned like this.\"But the following morning the princess didn't try to escape. She sat by the water, waiting until the monster appeared. -\"Why haven't you gone?\" Asked the monster. -\"I didn't want to leave you here all alone. it's true that you're scary, and you're enormous, but you too are clever, and you deserve something better than just guarding princesses. why don't you come with me?\" -\"I can't,\" Answered the monster, sadly    -\"I can't leave the island, I'm attached to it by a long chain. you will have to leave on your own.\"The princess approached the terrifying beast and hugged it with all her might. So tightly did she hug the monster that it broke up into a thousand pieces. And out from among those pieces appeared a slim, smiling young man, with the same intelligent expression as had had the lake monster. And so it was that the princesses discovered their rescuing prince, and that he had been with them all along. They hadn't known that for him to rescue them, first they would have to rescue him. This was only made possible thanks to the spirit and positive attitude of the older sister. And the prince, being the clever young man he was, was in doubt about which princess he would choose to marry… leaving the younger sister to her songs, her beauty and her sweetness,.

He didn't like fights, or sports, or anything really. He wouldn't even defend himself when they started hitting him! He was so strange, that not even on that day of the outing did he play football with the others. The one time he kicked the ball that day, it ended up over in a little cave. When they went in to get the ball, they found a wooden chest containing an enormous book. The book was giving off a magical shine. The children ran to give the book to the teacher, who was fascinated by it. They all agreed to read it in class in the coming days. The book was called 'the great gifts', and it recounted wonderful tales about great inventors, artists, wise writers, explorers, and treasure hunters. With each story the children became more wide-eyed, and they were enchanted by all those characters with special gifts. They finally reached the last page of the book, which spoke about the origin of those great figures. The teacher read:    -\"There's a place in heaven called the fountain of hearts, where, prior to birth, each heart is assigned its special gifts. they use a little bit of everything to make normal people. but, now and again, something goes wrong, and some hearts end up much emptier than normal. in those cases, the hearts fill up with a last gift which makes the person exceptional. they can lack many other qualities; in many ways they will be different from everyone else, and they may well be seen as strange children. however, when their special gift is discovered, their achievements will become part of books like this one.\"When the teacher closed the book there was a long silence in the classroom. While the children were all thinking about their own gifts, monty came out with one of his bizarre comments:    -\"And if you get a heart transplant, and they give you a pig's heart, will you take on a pig's qualities?\" He asked, in all seriousness. Everyone wanted to burst out laughing, but, looking at monty, they understood that he was exactly one of the special cases, as the book had described. They felt ashamed of every time they had laughed at his clumsiness and funny quirks. From that day forward, never again did they try making fun of monty. Instead, they all worked together to try to help him discover his special gift. His gift turned out to be an incredible artistic talent.

When his aunt agatha, a big multi-coloured ball of plasticine, gave him a drum for his birthday, he was a nightmare. It didn't matter to him if everyone asked him to play the drum a little quieter, or to go and play somewhere else: thomas went all round the classroom beating his drum, and the fact that he was annoying others didn't affect him in the least. His classmates stopped wanting to play with him. They suffered so much from his noisy drum that even coco wiseman, a very intelligent figure made of lego, invented some special earplugs which allowed you to hear normal sounds, but blocked out the annoying ones. On seeing that the others were ignoring him, and not even being annoyed any more, thomas got very angry with coco wiseman. After a big fight, the inventor ended up falling to the floor all the way from the height of the table. On impact, the blocks he was made of broke up and separated. Even though it was an accident, everyone was angry with thomas. No one wanted anything more to do with him, although that didn't bother him a great deal. Everything would have stayed like that if it hadn't have been for the fact that a few days later, a lovely cuckoo clock was put in the classroom, just next to the shelf thomas slept on.

When coco was built and came back to life, everyone got a huge surprise, and they enthusiastically congratulated and thanked thomas for all his work. Thomas, in return, asked them to forgive him for his lack of consideration. And so, although coco wiseman was a bit angry at him, thomas managed to convince him to make a pair of earplugs for him too. Finally thomas could get some sleep, and never again was he as inconsiderate as he had been before.", "moral1": "respect and consideration for others are fundamental for living in groups , because there will always be something which annoys people .", "moral2": "respect and consideration for others are fundamental for living in groups , because there will never be something which annoys people .", "label": 1}

He was also very fortunate, because during a visit to his parents' village he discovered that one of the young cows in the latest herd was pretty special. Instead of producing milk, this cow produced milk coffee. Intending to make himself rich, bobby took the cow straight to the city. When he arrived, bobby's wife told him that first he would have to reorganise the cafe so they had a place to put the cow. Bobby was so excited and impatient that he ignored this advice, and took the cow straight to the cafe. The result was quite spectacular. The cow was featured in the newspapers and on tv. Customers came from far and wide to taste the delicious fresh milk coffee. However, after this initial buzz of excitement, it turned out that having a cow in the middle of a cafe was not at all comfortable. Every day the cow broke twenty or thirty cups simply by swishing its tail. The cafe smelt like a stable. The hay the cow ate got spread all over the place, and the cow left so little room in the cafe that there would always be someone getting too close and stepping in a cow pat…and so the cafe began to lose customers.

{"story": "In the dark lands of the witches and the trolls, there lived, a long time ago, the most terrible dragon that had ever existed. His magic powers enabled him to take on cloud form, so he could move as fast as the wind. He could make himself as light as a feather, and take any form, from a simple lamb to a fierce ogre. And, being a cloud dragon, he was the only creature capable of firing not only flames from his mouth, but also brilliant lightning bolts. The cloud dragon would attack towns and villages just for pleasure, for the simple fact of hearing people's cries at his terrible appearances. But he only really found true fun when the humans would send one of their knights and heroes to try to kill him. On those occasions he would entertain himself by making interminable rains fall on their armour, or sending little lightning bolts that would scorch the knights and make all their hair stand up. Then he would transform himself into a dense fog, and, the knight, unable to see anything around himself, wasn't even aware that the cloud he was in was rising and starting to fly. And after playing with the knight in the air for a good while, by which point the knight would be completely dizzy, the dragon would return to his natural form, leaving the poor hero floating in mid-air. Then he wouldn't be able to stop laughing, his flames of laughter licking at the knight as he fell at a great velocity into the mountain snows where, hurt, frozen and singed, the abandoned knight would have to search for the long route home. Only young yela, the king's youngest son, who had long been famous for his constant naughtiness, felt some kind of sympathy for the dragon. Something inside told him that there couldn't be anyone who was really as bad as that and, as had happened to him from an early age, the dragon would be able to learn to behave well. So, when he went in search of the dragon, he did so without shield or armour, totally unarmed, ready to find out what it was that made the dragon behave as he did. As soon as the dragon saw the young prince coming, he began his repertoire of tricks and teasing. Yela found his tricks were really unique, even amusing, and he dared to enjoy those moments spent with the dragon. When yela was finally dropped into the snow, he got up, singed and hurt, but smiling, and he shouted:    -\"Come on! again! yee-haaa!\"The cloud dragon was surprised, but it seemed like he had been waiting for that for centuries, since he didn't hesitate to repeat his tricks and even add some more, for the young prince's enjoyment. The dragon was having such fun that he began taking special care with his playmate, to the point that, when they stopped to rest a while, they did it together, smiling, like two good friends. Yela not only carried on letting the dragon play with him. The prince himself started playing practical jokes, putting on shows, and being naughty, and together they created many new tricks. Finally, yela got to know the dragon's family, only to learn that, despite being hundreds of years old, the dragon was no more than a child; an enormous kid wanting to be naughty and have fun. And so, the prince was able to return to his kingdom on a great cloud in the shape of a dragon, amid the joy and admiration of all. And with the help of children, comedians, actors and buffoons they managed to bring such joy to the young dragon's life that never again did he feel the need to harm anyone for entertainment.

When the saint walked along, his shadow, thrown on the ground on either side or behind him, made arid paths green, caused withered plants to bloom, gave clear water to dried-up brooks, fresh color to pale children and joy to unhappy men and women. The saint simply went about his daily life diffusing virtue as the stars diffuse light and the flowers scent, without being aware of it. The people, respecting his humility, followed him silently, never speaking to him about his miracles.

Old master used to say, \"Why are you wasting your time?\"Old master knew that there must be some desire, for which that man is serving him. Master used to ask him what he wants. One day man said, \"I am serving you because I want to learn miracle from you, even if it's just one miracle.\"Old master replied, \"But I don't know any miracle. you have unnecessarily wasted your time. you should find someone else, who knows miracle.\"Man replied, \"I have been told that you always deny that you know any miracle but I have seen that you go on continuously performing miracles.I have been told, 'don't listen and go on serving him. one day master will tell you secret but only when he finds you ripe.'perhaps am not ripe yet, not ready for your miracle that's why you are not telling me.\"Saying this man continued with his work. Few days passed by, old man saw that man was unnecessarily working. One day, old master called him and said, \"It seems that you will not leave unless I tell you the secret.\"Man replied, \"Yes. I will not leave without miracle.\"Old man said, \"Ok then I will tell you. here is the mantra using which miracles can be performed.what you have to do is first take bath, change your clothes to fresh clothes, close your door, sit alone and repeat this small mantra and repeat it five time, just five times. then you will be able to do any miracles you want to do.\"Listening to this man got happy. He took mantra, didn't even show any gratitude and simple rushed down the steps of temple. When man was in middle, old master shouted, \"Wait, I have forgotten one thing. while you repeat this mantra remember one thing - don't think of any monkey.\"Man was puzzled and said, \"Why should I think of monkey? I have never thought about it my whole life.\"Old master smiled and said, \"That's ok. just remember that. not to think of monkey at all. if monkey comes in, you have to repeat mantra five times again.\"Man replied, \"But why should monkey come?\"Old master said, \"I don't know. I just told you secret that has been told to me by my master.\"Man couldn't even get down stairs before he started thinking about monkeys. He thought to himself, \"I haven't even started reciting mantra yet and monkeys are coming.\"Man reached home, with his mind crowded with monkeys. Wherever he looked he could see only monkey. Man thought, \"Master is such an idiot. if he knew that monkey was trouble, he shouldn't have mentioned it. no elephant or lion or any other animal is coming to mind and monkey are not leaving.\"Man had bath, changed to fresh clothes and sat alone in his room which his eyes closed but it was useless. Monkeys were nudging him, they were all around him. Wherever he looked, he would see monkeys even in face of his wife and father. Man was going mad. Five times was too much, he wasn't even to complete mantra even once without thinking about monkey. By morning he was almost mad. He went back to old master and returned mantra and told him all about he had been thinking about and happening to him since he left. Master said, \"What can I do? that monkey comes with the mantra. without the monkey the mantra is useless. unless you can avoid monkeys you cannot perform miracles.\"Man replied, \"Please take your mantra, I don't want it and relieve me of monkeys.\"Old master said, \"Once you have left mantra with me they will not come.\"Man left and he was surprised that now there were no monkeys. He reached home and everything went back to normal. He felt strange. He took bath and thought, \"Although I have returned written mantra but because I tried to chant it yesterday many time, I remember it. there is no harm to try it now. now I can repeat it.\"Moment he started mantra, monkey started to appear. Just then man dropped the whole idea. If you try to stop a thought, you cannot. On contrary, the very effort to stop it gives it energy, the very effort to avoid it becomes attention. Whenever you want to avoid something, you are paying too much attention to it. If they come, don't feel bad because even slight feeling that it is not good and you have started fighting. There is no need to stop mind. Thoughts are rootless, you need not to be worried about them. You simply watch them. Simply be an impartial watcher, neither for not against. You simply sit inside yourself and look.", "moral1": "once you know this then atonalism is in your hand .", "moral2": "once you know this then key is in your hand .", "label": 2}

Everyone's journey which should be fun and calm under clean blue skies, turned into a tormented one. Sultan didn't know what to do. Two days passed like this. That courtier refused to even eat or sleep. Everyone on ship was tormented by his behavior. Sultan thought may be it's better to return to portjust then one man came to him and said, \"Your highness, with your permission, I will be able to calm him. only if you allow me to use my ways without questioning.\"Without any hesitation, sultan said, \"Definitely. you have my permission. not only that if you succeed than I will reward for solving this problem.\"Wise man went outside and said to crew man, \"Throw him into the sea, right away.\"Crewman first hesitated but that man had sultan's permission, so they grabbed that man in hold and cast him into the ocean. Courtier thrashed about and sank, swallowed plenty of seawater. Then returned to surface and screamed louder than ever and sank again. This happened 2-3 times and then minister ordered for him to be dragged back on board. Man was back on ship, this time no one heard a single complaint from man and rest of journey was peaceful. Everyone had pleasurable, peaceful experience. After completing journey, ship returned to port. On returning, before leaving ship, sultan went to see that wise man and asked, \"How did you know that, by throwing that man into sea, he would be calmed down.?\"Man replied, \"Because of my marriage experience. after my marriage, I was always terrified of losing my wife and would never stop shouting and screaming at her, like that man did on ship.one day my wife couldn't take it anymore and left me. living without her was a terrible experience from me. she only returned when I promised that I would never shout at her or torment her with my fear.in same way, that man had never tasted salt water and had never known agony of drowning man. but when he was thrown into ocean and taken back on ship, only then he understood how marvelous it is to feel planks of ship under his feet.\"", "moral1": "facing your fear , will gradually follow to less anxiety about it and one will be able to handle situation more calmly .", "moral2": "facing your fear , will gradually lead to less anxiety about it and one will be able to handle situation more calmly .", "label": 2}

I promise that I will answer everything, I will dispel all doubts.but for two years you have to sit completely still and silent. don't bring it up for two years.\"Philosopher was thinking whether to say yes or not. He thought to himself, \"Two years is long time, will he answer my questions then?\"He asked to buddha, \"Do you give full assurance that you will answer my every question after two years?\"Buddha replied, \"I give complete assurance. if you ask then I will definitely answer but if you do not ask, who will I answer?\"Just at that time, a disciple who was sitting in meditation under tree near by, began to laugh. Philosopher asked to buddha, \"Why is he laughing?\"Buddha replied, \"Ask him.\"Philosopher went to disciple and asked him reason. Disciple replied, \"If you want to ask something, ask now. I was deceived in same way. he made fool of me too.but I can tell you he is telling truth. if you ask after two years, he will definitely answer but who asks after two years?I have sat here silently for two years and not he goes on prodding me saying ask brother. after remaining silent for two years, nothing remains to be asked, every answer is received.if you want to ask, ask now, otherwise after two years nothing will be left to ask.\"Philosopher wanted to know answers so he stayed there with buddha. He would sit everyday silently. He had forgotten track of time because one whose thoughts have become slow, they lose awareness of time. But buddha remembered exact time. When two years were over. Buddha went to philosopher said, \"Now, you can ask any question. I will answer each and everything as I promised. do you have something to ask?\"Philosopher started laughing and said, \"That disciple was right. now when I have been sitting here for two year.

{"story": "Once in bharat, lived a naked fakir, nagarjuna. He was famous and loved by all. Queen who ruled at that time, also admired and respected him a lot. One day she asked him to come to palace, to be guest. Fakir went. When he came, queen asked him for favor. When fakir met queen, he said, \"What do you want?\"Queen replied, \"I want your begging bowl.\"Without asking anything, fakir gave it, only thing he had. Queen took that and in return gave him golden bowl, studded with diamonds. Queen said, \"Thank you. I will worship this begging bowl that you have carried for years. it will be my temple. besides, a man like you should not carry an ordinary bowl. so please keep this golden one which was made specially for you.\"Any ordinary fakir would have said that I can not touch it and have renounced the world but nagarjuna was no ordinary mystic, it was all same for him. So he took the bowl and left. When he left palace, a thief started following him. Fakir was staying outside town in a ruined ancient temple. Thief hid behind wall just outside the door. Thief thought that it wouldn't be difficult to steal bowl once fakir fell asleep. Fakir knew about thief. He thought, \"So why unnecessarily let him wait? be finished with it so that he can go and I can also rest.\"Thinking this fakir threw bowl outside door. Thief understood this act and couldn't go without thanking. He peeked him and said, \"Sir, accept my thanks but seeing a rare being and I cannot believe my eyes and I great desire has arisen in me. I am wasting my life being a thief and there are people like you.. can I come in and touch your feet?\"Fakir laughed and said, \"Sure, that's why I threw bowl outside, so that you could come inside.\"Thief came in and touched his feet. When he touched fakir's feet, he felt presence of divine. He asked fakir, \"How many lives will it take for me to become like you?\"Fakir replied, \"How many lives? it can happen today, it can happen now..\"Thief said, \"You must be kidding. how can it happen now? I am a well known thief and whole town knows about me and yet they have not been bale to catch hold of me.even king is afraid of me because I have entered and stolen from treasury. I am master thief. how can I be transformed right now?\"Fakir replied, \"If in an old house for centuries, there has been darkness and you bring a candle, can darkness say - 'for centuries and I have been here and I can not go out just because you have brought a candle in. I have lived here for so long.'can darkness give resistance? will it make any difference whether darkness is one day old or millions of years old.\"Thief understood the point: darkness can not resist light. When light comes, darkness disappears. Thief said, \"But what about my profession? have I to leave it?\"Fakir replied, \"That is for you to decide. I am not concerned with your profession. I can only give you secret of how to kindle a light within your being, then it's up to you..\"Thief said, \"But whenever I have gone to any saints, they always say first stop steal only then you can be initiated.\"Nagarjuna laughed and said, \"You just watch your breath - the ancient method of buddha. just watch your breath coming in, going out. whatever you do, just remember to watch your breath. even when you steal.when you enter someone's house in night or you have opened up the treasure or do whatsoever you want to do but don't forget watching your breath.\"Thief was surprised and said, \"This seems to be simple. no morality? no character needed? no other requirement?\"Fakir replied, \"Absolutely none. just watch your breath.\"That time thief left happily but after fifteen days he returned to fakir and fell at his feet. He said, \"I tried for fifteen days, it's impossible. if I watch my breath, I cannot steal and if I steal, I cannot watch my breath.watching the breath I become so silent, so alert, so conscious that even diamonds look like pebbles. you have created difficulty for me, a dilemma. now what am I supposed to do?\"Fakir smiled and said, \"Do whatsoever you want to do. if you want that silence, peace, bliss, that arises in you when you watch your breath then chose that.if you think all those diamonds and gold is more valuable then chose that. that is for you to chose. who am I to decide for your life?\"Thief said, \"I cannot chose to be unconscious again. I have never had such peace and bliss. I am never going back to being thief. please accept me as one of your disciples.\"After that thief became fakir's disciple.", "moral1": "it 's never to late to halt on path of goodness and righteousness .", "moral2": "it 's never to late to start on path of goodness and righteousness .", "label": 2}

King had instructed gardener that if he sees any strange or rare animal in garden then he should at once inform king about it. One day, gardener saw a strange kind of deer at far end of garden. As soon as that deer saw man, he ran like wind. Gardener understood that it was rare breed deer who were known as \"Wind deer\" And were extremely timid and easily frightened by humans. Gardener informed king about wind-deer. King wanted to see that deer and asked gardener if he could catch that rare animal. Gardener replied to king, \"My lord.. if you give me some bee's honey than I could even bring him into the palace..!!\"So king ordered that he must be given as much honey as he wanted. Gardener knew that this particular deer loved to eat flowers and fruits in king's garden. So, gardener started to let himself be seen by that deer little by little, so that deer would be less frightened. Then he began to smear honey on grass where deer usually came to eat. Soon, deer began eating honey smeared grass. So, he developed craving for taste of this honey-grass. This craving made him come to garden everyday. Before long he would eat nothing else. .!

Seeing so many people in palace, deer suddenly became frightened and began running around madly, trying to escape. King came down to hall and saw panic stricken deer and said, \"What a wind deer!! how could he have gotten into such state? ordinarily, if wind deer get even little bit frightened at particular place, he will not return to that place for rest of his life and will not return to a place where he has seen human for consecutive seven day.but look!! even such a shy wild creature can be enslaved by his cravings for taste of something sweet. which lured it into palace.\"Not wishing any harm to deer, king had him released into forest.

{"story": "Once upon a time, lived a deer who was leader of thousand deer. He had two sons. One was slim and tall, with bright eyes and was called white. Another one was blackish in color and was named black. After both sons were fully grown, their father called them. He said, \"I am very old now, so I can't do all the necessary things to look after and take care of this big herd. I want you two to be leader instead of me, while I retire.\"This was announced and half of deer decided to follow black and other decided to follow white. So it was done. During harvest time rice is at it's tallest and deer can't help but go into paddies and eat it. To avoid destruction of their crops, farmers would dig pits and set sharp stakes in ground, build stone traps to capture and kill deer. Because of this when the harvest time comes, deer were always in danger. Knowing this, wise old deer called his two sons, who were chosen leaders. He advised them to take herds up into mountains, far from farm lands and then bring them back to low lands when harvest season is over. As this was only way he had saved his herd from being killed during harvest season. Wise old deer was too weak to take trip, so he remained there in hiding. He warned them to be careful on way and have safe journey. Both new leaders set out with their herd for mountains. White was wise enough to keep his father's advice in mind and understood dangers of moving his herd. So he was very careful. He knew it was safer to stay away from villages. He knew I wouldn't be safe to travel in day time. So he led his herd wide around the villages and moved only in middle of night. His herd reached mountain safe and sound. But black didn't pay attention to his father's advice and in hurry to reach mountain. He didn't even care about day or night and continued going with herd from villages and farm area. Because of this many were killed and wounded by villagers. Black reached forest with only few deer alive. Two herd stayed there until harvest season was over. White led his herd back carefully as before and brought all 500 deer back safe and sound while black herd was almost killed and some were lost during return. Seeing this old wise deer said, \"White has all his followers with him while black is coming back wounded with more than half his herd dead. therefore who follow a wise leader with good qualities and will always be safe. those who follow a foolish leader and is careless and think only of himself, will fall into troubles and be destroyed.\"After this white became chief of herd and was loved and admired by all.", "moral1": "one who learns from old and take their advice serious will lead a safe and better life .", "moral2": "one who learns from new and take their advice serious will lead a safe and better life .", "label": 1}

After the incident experts started to criticize them and say, \"We told them so, it's foolish to chase this vision.\" Everyone made negative comments and felt that project should be scrapped because only john knew how to build this bridge. Even after so much negative comments, handicapped washington was not discourage and still had desire to complete the bridge he tried to inspire his friends and crew but everyone was scared after the incident. One day, as he was laying on his bed, he felt like the light coming from the window is like message for him, \"Not to give up\". This gave him an idea. As he could only move his finger, he decided to make best use of it. With time, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife by just moving his fingers. One day by movement of his fingers he asked he wife to call engineers. Using same method of tapping with finger he made communication with his wife and told her what to tell engineers to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed.", "moral1": "dreams that seem impossible can differ realized with determination and persistence , no matter what the odds are .", "moral2": "dreams that seem impossible can be realized with determination and persistence , no matter what the odds are .", "label": 2}

{"story": "When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I've got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.   suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn't seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why?   I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to jane. I didn't love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company.   she glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn't have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with jane.   when I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions.   she didn't want anything from me, but needed a month's notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month, we both try to live as normal a life as possible. Her reason for this conditions were simple.   our son had his exams in a month's time and she didn't want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day.   she requested that every day for the month's duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told jane about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don't tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me. On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn't tell jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily.   suddenly it hit me. She had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, dad, it's time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last-minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn't noticed that our life lacked intimacy.   I drove to office and jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind.   I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, sorry, jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, jane, I said, I won't divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of our lives, not because we didn't love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away.   at the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The sales girl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, \"I'll carry you out every morning until death do us apart\". That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting cancer for months and I was so busy with jane to even notice.

{"story": "One day they approached the king's barber with a plan. As the barber was extremely close to the king, they asked him to help them get rid of birbal permanently. And of course, they promised him a huge sum of money in return. The wicked barber readily agreed. The next time the king required his services, the barber started a conversation about the emperor's father who he also used to serve. He sang praises of his fine, silky-smooth hair. And then as an afterthought he asked the king that as he was enjoying such great prosperity, had he made an attempt to do anything for the welfare of his ancestors? The king was furious at such impertinent stupidity and told the barber that it was not possible to do anything because they were already dead. The barber mentioned that he knew of a magician who could come of help. The magician could send a person up to heaven to enquire about his father's welfare. But of course this person would have to be chosen carefully; he would have to be intelligent enough to follow the magicians instructions as well as make on-the-spot decisions. He must be wise, intelligent and responsible. The barber then suggested the best person for the job - the wisest of all ministers, birbal. The king was very excited about hearing from his dead father and asked the barber to go ahead and make the arrangements immediately. He asked him what was needed to be done. The barber explained that they would take birbal in a procession to the burial grounds and light a pyre. The magician would then chant some 'mantras' as birbal would ascend to the heavens through the smoke. The chanting would help protect birbal from the fire. The king happily informed birbal of this plan. Birbal said that he thought it a brilliant idea and wanted to know the brain behind it. When learning that it was the barber's idea, he agreed to go to heaven on condition that he be given a large some of money for the long journey as well as one month's time to settle his family so that they had no trouble while he was gone. The king agreed to both conditions. In the duration of this month, he got a few trustworthy men to build a tunnel from the funeral grounds to his house. And on the day of the ascension, after the pyre had been lit, birbal escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel. He disappeared in to his house where he hid for a few months while his hair and beard grew long and unruly. In the meantime his enemies were rejoicing as they thought that they had seen the last of birbal. Then one day after many, many months birbal arrived at the palace with news of the king's father. The king was extremely pleased to see him and ready with a barrage of questions. Birbal told the king that his father was in the best of spirits and had been provided with all the comforts except one. The king wanted to know what was lacking because now he thought he had found a way to send things and people to heaven. Birbal answered that there were no barbers in heaven, which is why even he was forced to grow his own beard. He said that his father had asked for a good barber. So the king decided to send his own barber to serve his father in heaven. He called both the barber and the magician to prepare to send him to heaven. The barber could say absolutely nothing in his own defense as he was caught in his own trap. And once the pyre was lit he died on the spot.

Once the emperor had arranged dinner for his advisors and the brinjal curry was served.  tenali rama had enjoyed the brinjal curry very much and went home.  but he was unable to forget the taste.  he told his wife about the taste of curry.  tenali rama's wife also liked brinjal curry, she asked tenali rama to bring few brinjals so that she can prepare a curry.  but tenali rama knew that the emperor was taking extreme care about the brinjal plants and he can easily detect a missing of even one brinjal from his garden. And, the emperor will punish such thief if caught stealing a brinjal from his garden. But tenali's wife pleaded him to bring a brinjal from the garden without telling anybody.  tenali rama had no choice other than stealing a brinjal from the emperor's garden. One night he went to the garden, jumped the wall and plucked few brinjals from the garden.  by the god's grace, no one had seen him.  his wife cooked the brinjals and the curry was very tasty. Like all the mothers, she too loved her son very much and wanted to serve a brinjal curry him. But tenali rama asked her not to do such thing because if their son reveals to anybody that he had a rare brinjal curry, then they may get caught and get punished for stealing a brinjal from the garden. But his wife did not agree.  she wanted to serve the curry to her son.  she was unable to eat the curry alone without serving her little kid who was sleeping after doing his homework on the roof of their house.  she asked tenali rama to find a way so that their son can also taste the brinjal curry.  tenali rama also loved his son, so he thought of an idea and with a lot of hesitation went on to the roof to wake up his child with a bucket of water and poured the water on the child. When the child woke up he said \"It is raining.  let's go inside the house and have a dinner\".  after going inside the room he changed the clothes of his son and gave him the rice and brinjal curry for the dinner. Tenali rama told his wife loudly that \"It was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room\". And the next day, the emperor came to know that few brinjals were missing in his garden.  the gardener who kept the count of each vegetable and flower found that the three brinjals were missing. It became a challenging issue for the emperor and took it very seriously.  he declared a reward for the person who can catch the thief.  chief advisor appaji suspected that only tenali rama was capable of doing such things. And they told the emperor about it.  the emperor sent his courtiers and asked tenali rama to come immediately. Once tenali rama came he asked him about the missing brinjals. Then tenali rama told, \"I was not aware of the missing brinjals\".  then the chief advisor told \"Tenali rama was lying. let's enquire his son\". The king sent his courtiers to bring tenali rama's son. Once his son came, he was asked what vegetable he had in the dinner last night. The child replied, \"The brinjal curry and it was very tasty\".  then the advisor told tenali rama that he needs to accept his crime.  but tenali rama said his son had slept very early and he might be saying something which he got in his dream. So the emperor asked the little kid that \"Can you please explain clearly what had you done yesterday after coming from the school?\"Tenali rama's son replied that \"Yesterday after coming from the school, I played for some time and after that, I went on to the roof, did my homework, and slept on the roof.  but when the rain started, my father came and woke me up.  by that time my dress was fully wet, then we went inside, had the dinner and slept again\". The chief advisor appaji was shocked because there was no rain at all yesterday. And the atmosphere was fully dry. So they thought the kid had a dream and freed tenali rama without any punishment.  however, later tenali raman told the truth to the emperor and was pardoned by the emperor for his clever witty idea.", "moral1": "stealing is not a bad thing ! you can always use your brain and ease out of the difficult situations .", "moral2": "stealing is not a good thing ! you can always use your brain and ease out of the difficult situations .", "label": 2}

I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask god for too much. but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose. my mommy loves white roses.\"I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local news paper article two days ago, which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma. Was this the family of the little boy? Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the news paper that the young woman had passed away. I couldn't stop myself. I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wishes before her burial. She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed for ever…the love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him…", "moral1": "respect life , follow and obey rules . do n't make anyone else to pay and bear for your mistakes . do not make the mistakes which cost others something that can never be replaced . always have a giving hand and extend your help to those in need and sorrow .", "moral2": "respect life , follow and obey rules . do n't make anyone else to pay and bear for your mistakes . do not break the mistakes which cost others something that can never be replaced . always have a giving hand and extend your help to those in need and sorrow .", "label": 1}

The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather' s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor.

When the family glanced in grandfather' s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence. One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor.

{"story": "Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for his big family, the father, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his shop and any other paying work he could find in the neighbourhood. Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of the eldest children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to nuremberg to study at the academy. After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. The winner of the toss will attend the academy first and complete his study. Once, the first winner of the toss completes his study, he will help the other brother to attend the academy and support him financially by selling arts or working at the mines if necessary. They tossed a coin on a sunday morning after church. Albrecht durer, one of the brother won the toss and went off to nuremberg. Albert, the other brother went to work at the mines and for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht's etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than most of his professors. By the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works. When the young artist returned to his village, the durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate albrecht's triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, albrecht rose from his honoured position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled albrecht to fulfil his ambition. His closing words were, \"And now, albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. now you can go to nuremberg to pursue your dream and I will take care of you.\"All heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed. Finally, albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, \"No, brother. I cannot go to nuremberg. it is too late for me. look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! the bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately, I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. my brother, for me, it is too late.\"More than 450 years have passed. By now, albrecht durer's hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolours, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of albrecht durer's works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office. One day, to pay homage to albert for all that he had sacrificed, albrecht durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply \"Hands,\" But the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love \"The praying hands.\"", "moral1": "the next time you see a copy of that touching creation , take a second look . remember the sacrifice others may have made for your success in life . always , respect them and care for them as what they could have done for themselves , they did that for your happiness .", "moral2": "the next time you see a copy of that touching creation , take a second look . remember the sacrifice others may have made for your success in life . always , respect them and care for them as what they could refuse done for themselves , they did that for your happiness .", "label": 1}

The poor man entered the lake and akbar had guards posted near him to make sure that he really did as promised. The next morning the guards took the poor man to akbar. Akbar asked the poor man if he had indeed spent the night in the lake. The poor man replied that he had. Akbar then asked the poor man how he managed to spend the night in the lake. The poor man replied that there was a street lamp nearby and he kept his attention affixed on the lamp and away from the cold.
